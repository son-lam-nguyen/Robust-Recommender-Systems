The Grancia rooms are those in the building on the left as soon as you enter the complex, and includes rooms on the ground floor and 1st floor, a common kitchenette where you can make your own coffee or tea and store your stuff in the Frigidaire (but you cannot cook), a common area with a large table and chairs and WiFi is free and worked perfectly. The room was on the ground floor, it was large and comfortable with window opening on a private seating area outside. Cotto stone floors and high ceiling with wooden beams. No safebox in our room so keep note of it. TIP: You are in the countryside, it is normal to find some bugs here and there, the outside premises is full of plants and flowers therefore there are mosquitoes and bees so if you get bitten I suggest to bring mosquitoes repellants it will be very helpful. The breakfast is served in a lovely large room on a long table in a different structure you walk to. Homemade cakes made by the lovely owner Cinzia who makes also nice fresh eggs taken from her own chickens. She will prepare your cappuccino and eggs and you will also enjoy local cured meats,tomatoes, toasted bread cheese and more. To makes it clear for other guests this is not an Hotel but more of a room rental, Cinzia will go over and beyond to accommodate you but keep in mind you have to be organized because you are in the middle of nowhere so plan accordingly. Also, you will need a car to get to this area, no way around without . There is a small restaurant open at lunch only in the compound . The whole complex is very cute there is a lot of green, a bio lake where you can bathe in but has to follow the rules because it is a natural pond with plants and you have to shower before getting in and not use sunscreen or lotions you may compromise the waters and the plants. There is plenty of space to walk, lounge chairs and little cute gazebos to relax. Cinzia the owner and her daughter Alice are exquisite women very friendly and open minded. The structure has also an adjacent mill where you can buy homemade products.

The Grancia rooms are those in the building on the left as soon as you enter the complex, and includes rooms on the ground floor and 1st floor, a common kitchenette where you can make your own coffee or tea and store your stuff in the Frigidaire (but you cannot cook), a common area with a large table and chairs and WiFi is free and worked perfectly. The room was on the ground floor, it was large and comfortable with window opening on a private seating area outside. Cotto stone floors and high ceiling with wooden beams. No safebox in our room so keep note of it. TIP: You are in the countryside, it is normal to find some bugs here and there, the outside premises is full of plants and flowers therefore there are mosquitoes and bees so if you get bitten I suggest to bring mosquitoes repellants it will be very helpful. The breakfast is served in a lovely large room on a long table in a different structure you walk to. Homemade cakes made by the lovely owner Cinzia who makes also nice fresh eggs taken from her own chickens. She will prepare your cappuccino and eggs and you will also enjoy local cured meats,tomatoes, toasted bread cheese and more. To makes it clear for other guests this is not an Hotel but more of a room rental, Cinzia will go over and beyond to accommodate you but keep in mind you have to be organized because you are in the middle of nowhere so plan accordingly. Also, you will need a car to get to this area, no way around without . There is a small restaurant open at lunch only in the compound . The whole complex is very cute there is a lot of green, a bio lake where you can bathe in but has to follow the rules because it is a natural pond with plants and you have to shower before getting in and not use sunscreen or lotions you may compromise the waters and the plants. There is plenty of space to walk, lounge chairs and little cute gazebos to relax. Cinzia the owner and her daughter Alice are exquisite women very friendly and open minded. The structure has also an adjacent mill where you can buy homemade products. The major attractions are close by: Pienza is very close as well as Bagno Vignoni and San Quirico D’Orcia and you can also reach Montalcino and other small famous towns. Thank you Cinzia !",,,,,,,,,0.183154762,positive,5,1,1

26,DmitryStPetersburg,1821178,Agriturismi Il Castello La Grancia Pienza Tuscany,"Real castle - out of discussion. Must see, perfect experience I must start from the fact that it is a real castle. Out of discussion – real castle standing in the fields not far from Pienza. If you plan to explore Val d’Orcia I can strongly recommend you to choose this location. Of course highway is +/- 40 minutes away from this place but it is a perfect spot to enjoy the countryside for couple of days Montalcino and Montepulciano are really close to Spedaletto. Environment is nice, owners take care of area and you clearly see it at first sight. It is necessary to say a few words about bio-lake located on the territory – is a kind of pool (merely cold one) but without chemicals and more close to nature. There are some sunbeds, sun chairs and umbrellas near this bio-lake and you could enjoy some hours of sunny morning with the book relaxing with the view to hills and field nearby. The room is big enough, with comfy bed and renovated bathroom so you can feel like in a normal hotel inside the ancient castle with long history. This feeling is really amazing and impressive, I am glad to have this experience and could recommend it to all friends. The minor point is that the owner does not speak a word in English as I would like to discuss something but it is impossible. NO word at all, get ready to explain something with your hands and feet. There is one speaking person, the daughter of the owner but she is not always available and so normally you’d better speak Italian, this would help. Breakfast room is on the ground floor and you can’t reach it from inside so must pass the street but it is not a big deal. The choice of food for breakfast is not wide, I would expect to see more local and farm products but reality is different. Even cakes are not home-made, strange for such a place but nothing to do with it – may be this could be a point to improve in future. There is no restaurant for lunch and dinner and so you would have to drive to some village nearby to go to the restaurant – not always convenient, especially for wine tasting region… I was worried about the wi-fi signal quality because of thick castle walls but in fact it was not a problem, you have good connection in the room but practically no connection in the breakfast room (may be this was done on purpose – so that gest leave the breakfast faster ;-) ).

From the moment I saw the castle from the road, I knew I would have a special time in this agriturismo. It all started with some phone calls in which I talked with the owner about the time of my arrival for the check-in, communication was no problem and everything was easy to set up. I sent previously an email but I got no answer: I don't think they check emails that often. The castle is bigger than I expected, definitely imposing with its two towers. It dates back to at least 1236AD, a History lover like me could not miss a stay in a place like this! There are only seven rooms so it never felt crowded. My room, ""Torretta"", had a big communal space with cool old furniture with other two rooms: it's possible to prepare tea there. The room itself was spacious too: it had a corridor, a big bathroom with shower (rather new), a very comfortable bed, two couches and a small table: everything was deliciously set up. It felt VERY romantic! The gardens around the castle are lovely: there are roses all around, leading to the bio pool; around it some recliners where to relax. Beyond the gardens, only the cultivated fields for which Val d'Orcia is famous, with the Monte Amiata in the background: beautiful, stunning landscape! Quality of sleep is excellent: there is hardly any sound coming from the outside (if you don't take into account the call coming from the chicken coop in the morning!), the bed isn't noisy at all (I hate squeaky beds) and the two pillows given are of different kind, one softer and the other a bit thicker: great to have a choice on that too! Wifi is present and free of charge: not extremely fast, but reliable. The room felt hot the first day, but opening the windows was enough.

Nothing can replace the opportunity to sleep in a castle room, it's the most romantic experience a couple can have. All the sleeping rooms are connected by a dining room(completely furnished) available for guests in case they decide to prepare lunch or dinner by themselves. The location is fantastic, completed now by the new bio-lake that provide a totally different experience compared to a standard pool. Nearby the are many cultivated fields, at 5 minutes by car there is Pienza, one of the most beautiful villages in Italy, within 20 minutes by car many other famous places (Montalcino, Montepulciano, bagno Vignoni etc.). In order to enjoy the location and the opportunities of visiting good places is absolutely needed the car.

37,Domkoppie,1821178,Agriturismi Il Castello La Grancia Pienza Tuscany,"Delightful I never realized how exciting a castle could be for 2 adults until we arrived at the hotel. We explored the grounds like little children. It was beautiful! The service was great. The lady who received us could not speak any English but was so friendly and tried to make our stay as pleasant as possible. It was very clean and comfortable. We appreciated the use of a kettle which is not standard issue in Italy. Nothing is broken or not working. One can see that great care is taken by the owners to keep everything functioning as well as pleasing to look at. We were left alone all the time to enjoy the accommodation and especially the stunning pool area which totally blew us away. I have never experienced a real bog garden pool. The water was crystal clear with even a special floor covering for entry into the pool so that you don't have to experience the slippery sides. After a hot day in the car, a quick dip in the pool was very much appreciated. The gardens looked amazing! The wifi worked well. Breakfast was good. Parking was spacious. It was a close drive to Pienza for an evening stroll through the quaint streets. We were surprised when we finished our meal at Sette Di Vino, that it was already 8.50pm. We were able to drive back to the Castle in beautiful light enjoying the scenery and even still taking photographs. This is definitely the prettiest part of Tuscany that we saw. What I call 'The 2 Famous Zig Zag Roads' are both within 15 minutes drive of this lovely establishment. Of course, I googled long and hard beforehand to find them and mark them on my GPS. Please note that there are road closures in the immediate area (I think the SP18 and another one nearby too), and this caused us a few trips backtracking and eventually asking for directions at a nearby local shop.

Thank you Renato and other kind staffs. オーナーのレナートは英語が話せて、何か困ったことがあると常に助けてくれます。ランペドゥーザ島は英語が話せる人が少ないため、英語が話せる方が近くにいるのは非常に重要なことです。 ランペドゥーザの一番の目的地であるrabbit beachに行くのも、車で送迎してくれますし、無料でスクーターも貸し出してくれます。ボートに乗ったり、ダイビングをしたいときには、ショップも紹介してくれます。 部屋は綺麗で十分な広さがあり、清潔感がありました。ホテル内も掃除が行き届いていて、随所にオーナーのこだわりを感じます。屋上はリゾート感のあるスペースです。希望があればBBQも出来ます。 少し高いですが、その価値のあるホテルでした。もしもう一度訪れる機会があれば、もう一度泊まりたいホテルです。",5,,,5,5,,,,0.305980392,positive,5,1,1

We can't find enough positive things to say about this hotel. Renato runs the hotel perfectly, and all of the staff - the woman who runs the breakfast, the secretary, room cleaners, everyone - are both friendly and helpful. The service is in short some of the best we've seen. The rooms (more like mini-apartments) are kept spotlessly clean. Renato actually called us in Palermo the morning of our arrival to see if he could meet us at the airport (which he did.) He also quickly (2 minutes) arranged a car for us. The location is near the port, and close enough to Via Roma (the main drag) yet far enough away to be less noisy. Some rooms are near a busy traffic street, but as one of the Italian reviewers notes, the double-glazed windows solve any issues with this. The pool is a nice amenity after a hot day at the beach. The room decor is very bright and pleasant. In short, the goal of everyone at El Mosaico is to make your stay as pleasant as possible, and they succeed.

The swimming pool, however, was not open until 3 pm every day which ruled it out for us as afternoons and evenings were taken up with sightseeing and enjoying the restaurants in Bariloche town. The hotel restaurant only provided a buffet meal in the evenings and having experienced eating there at breakfast ( which was like a site canteena with closely packed tables and no table cloths) we decided not to avail ourselves of this amenity Also there is no bar in which to relax after those long days of sightseeing. Some of the staff on reception showed little interest in providing any a quality service and on our departure offered no help with our luggage despite the lift being out of order! The access road comprises a steep dirt track which is unsuitable for walking on except in walking boots.

The swimming pool, however, was not open until 3 pm every day which ruled it out for us as afternoons and evenings were taken up with sightseeing and enjoying the restaurants in Bariloche town. The hotel restaurant only provided a buffet meal in the evenings and having experienced eating there at breakfast ( which was like a site canteena with closely packed tables and no table cloths) we decided not to avail ourselves of this amenity Also there is no bar in which to relax after those long days of sightseeing. Some of the staff on reception showed little interest in providing any a quality service and on our departure offered no help with our luggage despite the lift being out of order! The access road comprises a steep dirt track which is unsuitable for walking on except in walking boots.

My husband, Son (11 years) and I stayed at the Hotel for one night as an extension to our time in France to finish off our Holiday in a relaxed style. We arrived early and were able to utilise the luggage storage and use the Hotel facilities immediately. We enquired about late check out as our plane was late the following evening, and as no one else had booked the suite, we were given an extra hour without charge, and were able to continue to use the pool until we left at 8.00 pm. The Suite was just as the pictures on the booking.com website through whom we booked. Our son loved his individually styled bed, and we liked the little balcony which overlooked the pool. There was a separate toilet to the nicely appointed bathroom with overhead shower, complete with a selection of toiletries; shampoos, hair net, manicure set, ear cleaners, and body cream. The only negative is that there are no tea and coffee making facilities. We loved the pool area, and particularly the Jacuzzi. We didn't have a problem in getting sunbeds either. Hot/Cold drinks can be obtained from the reception area, with a couple of choices of chocolate bar (no mini bar in room, bottled water provided only). Cocktails can be provided by reception until it closes at 10.30 pm. A pass-code for the back and front entrance are given should you be out partying later than that! The town is only 10 mins walk from the hotel. (Turn left out of the Hotel, walk to the underpass and turn left and keep going past the church - you won't miss it!). There is a park 5 minutes from the Hotel (turn right and walk the beach path) and a beach bar 2 minutes further along. There is a hotel instructions manual written in both French and English, and you are handed an Ile De Rey guide book when given your room key. We booked the 13 euro breakfast, but I wouldn't again and would have the 8 euro continental. The restaurant, attached to the Hotel (where breakfast is served) is a delight for afternoon and evening dining. We enjoyed some fantastic food and would highly recommend including the service. We chose the three course meal for £28 euros each, and felt it was fantastic value. The beach is excellent. Beautiful golden sand, which my son and I walked along up to and opposite the little lighthouse. Plenty of rock pools up at that end of the beach when the tide goes out, and we saw quite a few families with buckets collecting. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to travellers wanting a relaxing stay, or as a base with a car to tour the island.

We stayed here a week at an extortionate cost, although it is still cheap for the island generally. There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room and a small breakfast needs to be arranged the day before for a ridiculous price. The restaurant is also overpriced for the area. A short walk round the corner offers a wealth of good well priced restaurants for half the price. These include Le RéGalet, Le Platin, Pizza Re, La Plage and so on. The pool is unheated, freezing cold and positioned on the roadside. Not very appealing. We had the smallest balcony in the world, in a dark, corner located room for us and our 5 year old son. The balcony was so small you couldn't sit down. Pointless. It faced a back alley. As we were staying there after a week spent at my father's house near Aulnay, we had our own towels and a few smalls that needed rinsing through - especially after beach or pool days. We put these out to dry on the balcony. We were immediately shouted at by the neighbouring house whose back garden looked up at the hotel. Firstly a woman was screeching something at us in French about the balcony looking like a campsite. Then a man later shouted up to us to take our wet clothes and towels down. We refused. Its a balcony! Facing a back street alley and we had no where else to hang our stuff. The next day the hotel informed us they had a complaint about our wet towels offending the neighbouring house and to remove them immediately. I told the staff that in all my years of staying in hotels I had never been told that i can't use the balcony to hang out wet things. They just shrugged and said we could use the hotel's tumble dryer. (They dont offer a laundry service). Quite appalling and ridiculous. On our last night we were kept awake for hours by some couple having a very,very loud argument on the floor below us,. Not a great atmosphere for kids. Some of the reception staff are personable. There are no proper facilities. The 'shop' is a chiller in reception. No better than a vending machine. There's no bar, no snacks available and a limited staffed reception for just a few hours a day. The parking at 10 euros a day is bonkers. Use the car park on the beach opposite - it's free! And as for the Wifi. Forget it! It's sporadic and slow. There is also no lift to the first floor which means you have to drag all your luggage up and down two flights of stairs. Don't stay here if you have a mobility issue. I've given this hotel 3 stars because it was on the whole clean and convenient and enabled us to stay on a beautiful, if somewhat overpriced island. But the facilities are very, very basic.

121,BlogGrandVoyageur,483795,Le Grand Large Rivedoux Plage Ile de Re Charente Maritime Nouvelle Aquitaine,"Friendly staff, average hotel, good food For our first visit to Ile de Re we booked a two night stay at the Grand Large hotel. It had received positive ratings and we were looking forward to being near the beach and enjoying a sea view room. Our first (non hotel related) unpleasant surprise was that the bus service from La Rochelle train station to Ile de Re only runs every 3-4 hours on Sundays and holidays. Not wanting to spend a few hours waiting for the next bus we took a taxi for about 40 euros for the 20 minute trip. The hotel is located in the first village after crossing the bridge. The hotel faces a main road and to the left of the beach is a rather industrial view of the port of La Rochelle. The lady at the front desk was quite friendly and we were able to check in at 13:00 instead of 15:00 since our room was ready. She took us to room 111 on the ground floor. Unfortunately it was rather dark and facing the parking lot on the rear. There was also a strong ammonia smell in the bathroom. We opened the windows to air out the room and then left to pick up our rental bikes. (The hotel also rents bikes, bur we'd already reserved at another shop.) We realized that the hotel is rather far from the center of the village (15-20 min walk) and there really isn't too much to see in Rivedoux anyway. We much preferred La Flotte and St Martin-de-Re. On our return we were able to access the rear entrance/ parking (10 € per night if you come by car) with the security code provided at check-in. Since there are no other restaurants nearby we decided to try the hotel restaurant and we enjoyed a really nice meal of oysters and fish of the day. Service was friendly and we only found the house wine rather bland (splurge for a better wine) and the dessert overpriced (9.50€ for a simple creme brulee). It was the best meal amongst three restaurants we tried and I'd give the restaurant a 4 out of 5. Otherwise the room was clean and relatively spacious. We could hear the occupants in the room above ours, tv and free wifi worked trouble free. The bathroom was ok except for the ammonia smell, with a bathtub and plenty of hot water.

I loved staying here but there was a distinct lack of customer interaction - no one at the desk ever greeted us and when we checked in, the receptionist seemed irritated and dealt with us as quickly as possible - not offering any information about breakfast, amenities etc. This is absolutely fine but given that everywhere else I have stayed in, in Andalucia has had front-of-house staff that have been so kind and helpful, I think Gran Sol fell short. The hotel was clean and the pool area was great. Breakfast was reliable and did the trick. If staff had been warmer towards us, this place would score 5. I would go back for sure.",,,,,,,,,0.391666667,positive,4,1,1

This was our second stay at the Gran Sol after we fell in love with Zahara de Los Atunas last summer. This is without a doubt the best located hotel in the area, right on the sandy beach, but also has an excellent pool, which is great as the beach can be a little too windy at times. There are dozens of really good restaurants within a few minutes stroll but as we did last year, opted for the half board option which represents good value. Breakfast was traditional European fare, hams, fruit, toast etc but was plentiful and the coffee is excellent.

Stayed for nine nights in August and had a really relaxing time, so much so that we cancelled a few days in Seville at the end of our holiday to stay in Zahara de los Atunes. Everyone knows the hotel , it's alandmark in the town because of it’s envious location, right on the beach and just a stones throw from all the bars and restaurants. We arrived mid afternoon to be greeted at reception by the very lovely Patricia, who was the only English speaking person at the hotel, apparently we were the only English guests, but we liked that. I asked if it was possible to get a sea view room but apparently the hotel was full. Our room was very spacious with high ceilings and an exceptionally comfortable bed, a bit dated though. It had a large flat screen TV but with only one English (news) channel, but we hadn’t come to watch TV. The room was cleaned daily and met all of our needs. My only gripe would be that there was no in room safe, so I had to keep my valuables in the safe at reception, it wasn’t a problem but would have been more convenient. The shower head didn’t fix properly to the wall so it had to be carefully placed under an arm or between the legs whilst washing, again not a big deal but it would have been more convenient. We were in room 219 which is on the side of the hotel directly above a busy bar and restaurant, it was pretty loud until around 2am, this was the only thing that spoiled our stay, our sleep quality was poor. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful with excellent coffee, (don’t expect a full English) the communal areas are nice and the pool clean, tidy and under used probably because the beach is so nice. We had initially booked room only but upgraded to half board for what I thought was a small sum so that if it wasn’t great (as some hotels can be) we’d simply eat out at one of the scores of lovely restaurants near by, however we were very surprised at how good the food was especially as the tables were laid out so lovely with nice cutlery and proper linen napkins (That’s how I judge a restaurant) The service was prompt and respectful, I know a previous contributor was upset by the waiters attitude but nobody spoke any English and I think some things could get lost in translation. Parking can be a problem as the entrance to the beach is right by the hotel, we were unbelievably lucky and parked directly out side the hotel for free but there are several nearby car parks for only 2 euro’s a day. I have been all over Spain but for me, Zahara de los Atunes was the nicest place I’d been to, it was so chilled, relaxing and unspoilt, I never saw one football shirt or ipad, it was like stepping back in time, didn’t even see too many mobile phones, I would go back tomorrow at the drop of a hat and despite it’s small failures I’d stay in a quieter room at The Gran Sol Hotel.",Hotel_Review-g666710-d498653-Reviews-Gran_Sol_Hotel-Zahara_de_los_Atunes_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,2015-09-01T00:00:00,I'll be back!!,"Stayed for nine nights in August and had a really relaxing time, so much so that we cancelled a few days in Seville at the end of our holiday to stay in Zahara de los Atunes.

The biggest positive about this hotel is its location, literally on the beach and walking distance to the nice bars and restaurants in the town. The rooms are a good size, a little dated, but clean, air conditioned and the beds comfy. No complaints for a 3 star hotel at this price. The lack of in room wifi is slightly dull - the only place it works is in reception. However the reason I would not return to this hotel or recommend it to anyone was the attitude of the staff. On arrival and checking in, we went to our room (a superior with sea view) to find that my request for a room with a double bed not twin beds had been ignored or missed. I went back to reception with my booking information on which I had specifically requested a double and was told that there was nothing he could do as the hotel was full. I pointed out that I had booked in February, that the request for a double had been acknowledged, and also that it was my girlfriends 30th birthday that day and the guy couldn't have acted like he cared less if he tried. He literally just shrugged his shoulders and then turned away started typing on this computer like the conversation was over! I asked if I could speak to the manager and he told me that the manager wasn't available but if I came back and saw him tomorrow lunchtime he might be able to move us to a different room but couldn't make any promises. I declined as spending the first morning of my stay hanging round until lunchtime on the off chance he could move us didn't seem that appealing. This kind of attitude towards the guests appeared to be the norm across most of the staff. The bar was quite pleasant with a nice view down to the beach but the staff were unfriendly, never came to your table to ask if you wanted a drink and when you went up to the bar to ask for one often cleaning glasses appeared to be more of a priority than taking customer's drinks orders. I also made the mistake to ask about where to park my car. After being told that the hotel doesn't have a car-park (which I did already know - I can read), I asked if they could recommend somewhere to park. I was told they could not. I said that I had parked in the beach car-park (close by and only 2 euros a day) and did they think that would be ok for the 4 days or was there somewhere better - I got the same shrug I got when I mentioned there was a problem with my room.

The hotel is comfortable enough, glorious views from the balconies, room was clean and comfortable, the half-board was a mistake as the selection and quality of food was poor. What really irritated was the attitude of the staff and, particularly, of the duty manager. On the first evening in the hotel I slipped in the bath while having a shower, banged my ribs on the edge of the bath and was in considerable pain for the remainder of our stay. We reported my fall to the duty manager; he couldn't have cared less and other than having a non-slip mat put in the bath on the following morning ignored my plight totally.

This hotel's location is second to none - right on the sea front - and Zahara de los Atunes has long been a favourite for beach visits with my family. We live 1.5 hrs away and regularly visit this isolated fishing-village-cum-tourist-resort in the summer. But this is the first time we had stayed in one of its hotels. If the quality of a business is a reflection of its owner, the owner of this particular hotel - to be found in the hotel's cafe on most days - does not pay sufficient attention to detail. The design of Gran Sol is very good and there's no sense of claustrophobia - rooms, bathrooms, restaurant, cafe, pool area etc are all of decent dimensions. Here are some of the issues we noted: Toilet brush was filthy - hey, they only cost a euro each, so get a new one! Towels were too small Sheets on bed were too small Plants and flowers in pool area were unkempt Two cats frequented the pool area most of the time The sound of birds in the overgrowth on the balconies was constant rather than comforting - nothing against the birds, but cut back on the growth! Breakfasts included the cheapest kind of yogurts (the type that needn't be kept in a fridge). Same for the milk. Distinct lack of fruit options. Breakfast options the same every day. We didn't try an evening meal at this hotel Cleaning staff very friendly but perhaps not briefed on their full roles. For example, it appeared they never cleaned the bathrooms I tried for the advertised wireless connection and got 'local access' only ie no internet.

First of all when I got there at 10pm on a Wednesday night the reception was close but its understandable. I had a code which was to let me in then a another code for my room key. The code to let me in did not work. So its about 1030pm and I cannot get into the building. long story short they have another hotel around (nicer) about 5 blocks away which gave me a key. When we asked the front desk the next day why the code didn't work they said they had to change it for a security purposes. An email with the new code would of been nice. The next day we noticed the room wasn't cleaned so we needed clean towels. We called and they said they don't clean but will for an additional 15 euros a day. So we were staying for 5 nights and were expected to use the same towels/ linens.

On check in Matilda was very pleasant and took her time with us giving us directions to local restaurants and a place to get some groceries. So here we go: If you turn to the left you will see plenty of places to eat, as well as a small grocery store and a laundromat all within a 2 minute walk. There are also some bakeries and a few pharmacies. You'll find nail bars and hairdressers along here too. At the main intersection there is a metro station ""Charles Michels"" which is on line 10. Bus 42 runs straight past the front door of the Adagio which takes you to Paris train station Gare du Norde (but I didn't take the bus so can't comment). When you get to the main intersection if you turn right and walk 5 minutes you will see Marks and Spencer which is fabulous for groceries and sandwiches as well as meals for the microwave. There is a cinema which is great and more shops and places to eat. If you turn right from the Adagio and take the first sharp right this street will take you to another metro station ""Dupleix"" which is an elevated station of the Paris Métro serving line 6 in the Boulevard de Grenelle. This metro takes you to the RER which runs to and from Paris airport CDG. This metro is also 2 stops from the Eiffel Tower though it is only a 20 minute walk. As for the room: We stayed in room 602 which had a balcony and a view of the Eiffel Tower (I added photos of room 602) The room was equipped with a small kitchen, table, bed and TV (no English channels) The bathroom was standard. Overall the room was warm so we didn't need heating, bed was ok and we heard nothing from other guests. The whole building needs to be refurbished as it is very old and has water damage. That said, the location was the main attraction for us and that didn't disappoint. This in an apartment so there is no daily cleaning however you can have this service for 15 euro.

I travel as much as I can with little money and this will be my fourth time in Paris. All my previous hotel visits have accommodated our needs when it came to changes to itineraries or reasonable requests. I booked this hotel at a Non-Refundable price and my girlfriend and I were originally okay with the dates that we discussed. But 30 minutes after booking the hotel my girlfriend was advised that she could not take any days off next January. So we had to make a change to our reservation fast. We looked at the information online on how we could handle this problem. It advised us that any change requests had to be communicated directly to the hotel. So we had the hotel contacted by the company that took our booking and they were led to believe that the date change to February would be ok. Since I had 24 hours to change or cancel my flight without penalty, I changed the date of the flight based on what the hotel staff advised my booking company. I requested an email be sent to me to confirm the change and never received it. It was one excuse after another and the manager never took ownership of our problem and attempt to resolve the issue. After calling my booking company multiple times, the hotel staff advised that they would not make the change. My booking company requested to speak to the manager and the hotel employee told my booking company to make their request by email. I work in a customer service environment and we would be reprimanded for this type of behavior and lack of customer service. It is a reasonable request to change the reservation dates from January 19 – January 26, 2014 to February 2 – February 9, 2014. I’m not asking for a lot.

Being only 21, this was good for us and we mostly walked everywhere anyway. Negatives; I have no problem with self sustained apartments, however this is advertised as a hotel and it definitely is not a hotel, it's an apartment. Which means no cleaning and no requirements for any staff to be there. Whilst I'm happy with a self sustained, it was not what I booked. It should not be advertised as a hotel Cleaning; BIG problem. The entire time of our stay (4 nights) we did not see a cleaner once! It wasn't so much we wanted our beds made and such but we wanted new toilet paper, rubbish taken out ext. we had to buy our own toilet paper in the end. By the 4th night I was happy to go because I was sick of the mess and I feel like I shouldn't have to sweep/ clean mirrors on my holiday Beds; the beds are a pull out couch. At first I was angry but they are actually quite comfortable. The only issue is they are so squeaky and loud. You move a tiny bit an it squeaks profusely. To put it this way, if there was someone on the honeymoon in the hotel, every guest would know. lack of staff in general; whilst this was not a problem for us as we have been to Paris the year before and had few questions, i suggest if it is your first time go to a place with a proper reception. A lot of the one no one is at reception and there is no one to help with questions Other small points; hot water was playing up one of the nights, lift is a bit old and worrying because it only holds 2 people and if it breaks down there's no one in the hotel to get you out lol Overall for 2 21 years olds it was fine.

Size of the rooms are very good for Paris standards and all have outside space (either a balcony or terrace) Great in the summer with a glass of wine and a view of the Eiffel tower now the negative: the rooms (and we stayed in 5 different ones) ALL need major work, we're talking ugly big stains on the carpets, chairs that have ripped covers (in one of the rooms out of 4 chairs only one was relatively ok with just a side rip!!!) The sofa beds in some of the studio rooms have a very thin and old mattress that left for a very very uncomfortable nights sleep, very noisy and badly insulated from traffic noise, Most of the doors and windows don't close very well which makes it drafty - hate to imagine staying here in winter The service:hm..... well they are friendly and they do speak English which is rare in paris hotels of this standard but........ you do feel that they are doing you a HUGE favour by letting you stay in their rooms, and I overheard them giving the price over the phone in French (I think they did not realise I speak fluent french) which was hugely reduced to the rate we were offered as foreigners, (they charged the repeat client the guy was speaking on the phone with 85 Euro!!!) Anyhow if that is the hotel policy then I suggest they do not do reservations at the front desk at the same time as they have clients checking in. The rooms were badly cleaned and the rubbish was never removed ( we later discovered in fact there is a note in the room asking you to take your own rubbish out, even in other Apart-hotels we've stayed in we have never had to do that!!) In the weekend the place is like a ghost town you have a very nice front desk guy who unfortunately only works in the weekend for a couple of hours in the morning but at other times the front entrance is closed and there is NO ONE to ask or speak to for help, which is a bit worrying as they have a note on the lift saying no more than 2 people (even though the lift says up to 400KG) it made us wonder what happens if the lift gets stuck in the weekend when the hotel is closed and there are no staff??? so we always took the stairs, or worst if there is a fire??? Overall bad service, bad quality, cleaning leaves a lot to be desired (had stained sheets in most beds - I guess they were washed but the stains stayed, and threadbare towels they really should invest in new linens) Stay here if you want a big room (i assume coming to paris staying indoors is not really a priority) or if you need to stay in the area otherwise we highly suggest you find somewhere else until this hotel cleans up it's act and realises it's not still so great as perhaps it once was. we will not be coming back and would not recommend it to our friends",Hotel_Review-g187147-d578345-Reviews-Adagio_Access_Paris_Tour_Eiffel_Saint_Charles-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,2011-10-01T00:00:00,Posive and negative points read before booking,"To start with the positive, Location is very convenient as others have stated.

It was about a 15 min. walk to the Eiffel Tower. * The small kitchenette was useful. * We stayed on the 4th floor. The view of the Eiffel Tower, that we were promised, can only be seen while hanging over the balcony. * The bed is extremely hard...seroiusly, I've slept on floors and in tents that were much more comfortable. There was no headboard, as some people prefer them. * The elevator only holds 2 people at a time and is extremely slow...it's faster to walk up the stairs. When it would stop, it felt as if it was going to crash back down to the 1st floor. * The room is not cleaned daily, but towels and toilet paper are left. The bed was made once by the maid in 5 days. You are expected to clean the room and take out your own trash before you check out or your charged 25 euros. * The TV turns on and off by itself. * The shower in the bathroom only has a half door, so the entire bathroom gets soaked when you take a shower. The towels are small...more like hand towels and there are no wash cloths. There is water damage and the walls are peeling badly. * The walls are paper thin, so not only can you hear your neighbors, you can smell what their cooking as well...not always pleasant. * The room is small, but from what I've read, it's large compared to other hotel rooms in Paris.

The rooms were made everyday, and the cleanliness was superb. The hotel is located near the Eiffel Tower, and next to the underground line 6 (which is aerial and it's worth taking at least once). The breakfast is correct for a Southern style (milk, coffee, cocoa, juices, apple compote, boulangerie, bread, butter, cereals and some milk derivatives). The very first day (and regretfully that day alone) we enjoyed the best bread we took in the whole trip. One day, on the last hour for breakfast, they ran out of butter, though. The rooms are well equipped and spacious. The bed is big, at least is very comfortable for a 6ft person, and the mattress seemed rather new. On the con side, although the hotel announces hi-speed internet access, it is not installed by default in any room, and a special device with ethernet connection has to be given in order to connect.

255,Samiantha,578345,Adagio Access Paris Tour Eiffel Saint Charles Paris Ile de France,"A great little gem My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend in Feb. We booked the room with the sofa bed. Location wise this hotel is perfect, its on a quiet street with little or no noise. The street is well lit, and I would feel safe walking along by myself. The hotel is about a 10minute walk to the Eiffel tower and has two different metro lines either side of the main roads. You can get to Notre-dame and disney easily via the RER C from the Eiffel tower. Room wise the hotel was comfortable. We had a big room with a balcony facing the back which could fit a table and some chairs on in the summer. The kitchen had a little dishwasher, microwave, 2 hobs, fridge and a coffee maker perfect for making sandwiches and having breakfast. The bed wasn't the comfest in the world, and potentially was the noisest bed ever....therefore I would recommend you pay the extra £5 or £7 a night for the superior room. We had a busy weekend, and went to see the Mona Lisa on the Friday, climbed the effiel tower on the saturday, did some shopping and went to Eurodisney on the Sunday. We enjoyed all the little restuarants and the atmosphere around Notre Dame in the evening, with happy hour lasting for 7-9.30pm in most of the bars (half price on cocktails) (easily to get to via the RER C).

We booked very far in advance (more than 9 months) and got a really great deal, 81E/night for a studio room. We were there for 7 nights.

The bed was firm, but really comfortable, the sheets clean. Hard wood floors and heavy dark drapes were lovely as well. We really enjoyed the area this hotel was in.

257,JaxGallaghan,578345,Adagio Access Paris Tour Eiffel Saint Charles Paris Ile de France,"Great studio We arrived at the Citea Tour Eiffel on 5 September. My mum and I had organised a shuttle from the airport and unfortunately had used a booking agent who hadn't passed on payment details to the driver. On arriving at the hotel the reception staff were superb and helped allowing me to use the internet on the reception desk to get confirmation and payment details. We had two superior studios located on the 4th and 5th floor (rooms 403 and 503), both had a view of the Eiffel Tower from the balcony. The rooms were clean and basically furnished. It was great to have a fridge (for keeping our wine chilled). The lift is small, one person plus case, or two people in total, a bit slow, but I tended to walk up the stairs, so it wasn't an issue. I needed reception again and this time a different receptionist, allowed me to use the bosses office for the internet, again she went out of her way to help. Something to note though is that the reception is closed between 12-2pm, so if you are arriving or leaving around this time, I suggest you have a drink/lunch at the bistro on the corner, its very good, especially the smoked salmon and gorgonzola pizza...... Its about a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, about a 5 min walk to two different metro stations, so very handy to get around. We did a few tours: City Tour/Trip on the Seine/Lunch at the Eiffel Tower - This was good as the Seine trip could be taken any time not just on the day of the tour. Lunch at the Eiffel Tower was better than expected, but they did keep topping up my wine glass. The City Tour was a bit of a disappointment as it was a closed double decker and you didn't feel as close to the city as you would have done on an open topped bus. Da Vinci Code Walking Tour - this was fab, we found details in our hotel, it was €20 and they meet at 10.30 outside the Ritz. It took about 2 hours and was easy walking, the guide was American and he explained a lot more than we expected on the tour. It was well worth the money. Moulin Rouge - This was exceptional, we had dinner and the show with 1/2 bottle of champagne included each. Additional bottles cost €50, but hey, you only do it once. It was a lot better than I expected and definately worth doing. Montmatre and Sacre Coeur - get there early to avoid the crowds. There is a little train that takes you on a short tour, it costs €5 and worth it. Travels down Montmatre to where the Moulin Rouge is and back again. Louvre - We just went in one wing (Denon), this is where Mona Lisa, Madonna of the Rocks, Venus di Milo are. We took the audio guides for the Da Vinci Code at €10 and it is €9.50 to get in - we were in about an hour and a half. On the Friday night we went to a very different restaurant called: Nos Ancetre Les Gaulois on the Isle St Louis. It had an all inclusive menu at €39 which included a massive basket of salads and vegetables, meats cooked on the fire, cheese board, dessert and all you could drink red wine from the barrel... plus a singer who came round to the tables... It was a fun night and it is heartily recommended. Montpanasse Tower is worth a trip up, €9.50 to get to the top of the tower, go early to avoid queues, 56th floor is inside, two more flights of stairs get you to the outside viewing area... Fabulous views from the top. Last thing Metro Tickets - buy 10 at a time for €11.50, one ticket does a journey within Paris from beginning to end, even if you change Metros, you can also use them on the fenicular to get up to Monmatre and on the standard buses. We ended up buying two sets of 10, plus 4 extra. The single tickets cost €1.50 each. We were there 5 days and found this to be the cheapest/best option.

The room was very large with a lot of room around the bed and a lot of storage room, a table with 3 chairs, a small kitchen with a microwave oven and a balcony.

286,OneFussyGuy,202454,Hotel am Borsigturm Berlin,"Hotel advertises a gourmet restaurant, but it is TERRIBLE and has NO SERVICE Room was fine. Location was fine. Needed hotel near airport that also had a decent restaurant. This advertised one of the best restaurants in town. Unfortunately it is NOT. They even told me I needed to reserve a table in advance just to get in, because it would be so crowded. I reserved 7:30. When I came into the small restaurant sporting only a few tables, it was less than half full. There were maybe only three or four parties in the whole restaurant. First, the waiter told me that four or five items on the already very small menu were unavailable. How this could be at 7:30pm when the restaurant was only half full is a great mystery to me. It speaks of horrible planning by the owner, or simple false advertising. After placing my order within 3 minutes for the simplest entree on the menu (breaded chicken with salad), I proceeded to wait 45 minutes... NOTHING came. I stood up went over to the waiter and asked him what was the status of my order. He said it was coming right out. I waited another five minutes, nothing came, nothing was coming. I went over and asked to speak to the manager. There was no manager. The waiter ignored me, did not even apologize, and puttered about like a complete jerk. I then went to the front desk of the hotel and asked to speak to the manager, and of course there was no manager on duty. I told the clerk I wanted to speak to the manager, and she said he would get back to me tomorrow. I explained that there should ALWAYS be a manager on duty, and that I would be back home in the USA tomorrow. The level of indifference, arrogance, and disregard for the customer was truly astounding. At that point, I went back to my room, put on my coat to go out, and stopped back at the restaurant one more time asking to speak to the chef. The same arrogant, incompetent waiter told me to wait outside in reception, at which point I told him no thank you, and that I wanted to speak to the chef. The restaurant has an open kitchen and I could see two cooks there, but I didn't know which one was the chef. The waiter continued in his arrogant dismissive manner, and I insisted upon speaking with the chef. Eventually, he told me that he was the chef, which he obviously was NOT. He was simply the incompetent, arrogant, and ill-mannered waiter. At that point, I left, went across the street to McDonalds, and had a very tasty set of chicken wings.

First, the waiter told me that four or five items on the already very small menu were unavailable. How this could be at 7:30pm when the restaurant was only half full is a great mystery to me. It speaks of horrible planning by the owner, or simple false advertising. After placing my order within 3 minutes for the simplest entree on the menu (breaded chicken with salad), I proceeded to wait 45 minutes... NOTHING came. I stood up went over to the waiter and asked him what was the status of my order. He said it was coming right out. I waited another five minutes, nothing came, nothing was coming. I went over and asked to speak to the manager. There was no manager. The waiter ignored me, did not even apologize, and puttered about like a complete jerk. I then went to the front desk of the hotel and asked to speak to the manager, and of course there was no manager on duty. I told the clerk I wanted to speak to the manager, and she said he would get back to me tomorrow. I explained that there should ALWAYS be a manager on duty, and that I would be back home in the USA tomorrow. The level of indifference, arrogance, and disregard for the customer was truly astounding. At that point, I went back to my room, put on my coat to go out, and stopped back at the restaurant one more time asking to speak to the chef. The same arrogant, incompetent waiter told me to wait outside in reception, at which point I told him no thank you, and that I wanted to speak to the chef. The restaurant has an open kitchen and I could see two cooks there, but I didn't know which one was the chef. The waiter continued in his arrogant dismissive manner, and I insisted upon speaking with the chef. Eventually, he told me that he was the chef, which he obviously was NOT. He was simply the incompetent, arrogant, and ill-mannered waiter. At that point, I left, went across the street to McDonalds, and had a very tasty set of chicken wings. Do NOT waste your time or money on this place. It is a joke.",2,3,,,,3,,,0.011607143,neutral,2,0,0

The check in staff were friendly and accommodating. I was given a voucher for two free drinks at the bar which was a nice touch. There is free coffee, cocoa and water (sparkling and flat) in the lobby and each evening/afternoon there are sweets available - our first night they had cheese cake!! When they say free parking is limited, they mean it! If no spaces are available alongside the hotel or on the street you can pay for parking in the Hallen am Borsigturm which runs €6.80 for the entire time the car is parked. You move the car and come back and you pay again! The room is compact but efficient (modern European style) and has sufficient space to walk around. There is a shower and no bathtub and the sink has sufficient space for your toiletries. They have squeeze soaps and shampoo, as is common in more European Best Westerns I have stayed at. The bed is comfortable enough with two pillows on each bed. There is a nice mini bar that has space for you to place items that need to be kept cold and there is a safe large enough for you to secure your laptop(s). There is a small niche near the bathroom is you need to hang anything that basically serves as a closet but it has no door. There is a desk and a nice shelf you you to spread out items as well as a bench for one suitcase. The TV is mounted is on the small side and mounted on the wall. There is no place to put your key in order to turn on the lights - I like that feature as I know it saves on energy use since the lights go out when you pull your key. I am surprised this hotel does not have that feature. The Hallen Borsingturm next door has lots of restaurants at good prices so you have many choices for meals. There is also a very large Rewe grocery store there where you can stock up on snacks and beverages. The hotel's restaurant is on the pricey side but not bad - main dishes for €17. Breakfast is exceptional. All of the items you would expect to see are here: breads and seeded rolls, cereal, milks, preserves, yogurt, cheese, meats, four types of juice (to include grape), boiled eggs, scrambled eggs and sausages. You can get made to order omelets and french toast and they even have a waffle maker on the buffet. I absolutely enjoyed breakfast - just wish I could eat more at one time.

339,27L09R,202454,Hotel am Borsigturm Berlin,"Clean & basic but lacking any wow factor This hotel is easy to get to from Tegel airport as you can take the frequent bus TXL 128 from outside the terminal until the metro station Kurt-Schumacher-Platz. Here you have to change inside the metro U6 in direction Alt-Tegel a single ticket will cost you just 2.40 Euros and does the bus & metro. The stop for the hotel is the metro station called Borsigwerke Arrived early evening and were welcomed by a friendly member of staff. I corrected some information they had wrong about me on check in - despite this they still insisted on addressing me as ""MR"" even on check out I find this rude when I'm a ""Miss"" We were given our key cards and directed to the lifts. I had paid approx £150 for 2 nights double room with breakfast. On getting to our room I looked through the hotel information folder but nothing about the free WiFi - so I had to go down to reception to ask for this. It's a shame you have to ask as things - this should have been offered at check in! I later discovered that this password was only for one device so you need another password for any other devices. I also noticed it wasn't the double I had booked! It was a twin and no way of moving them together. Again why wasn't this mentioned at check in? To do things on the quiet I find is rather sneaky behaviour! The room was clean but looked basic - the furniture and surroundings lacked any wow factor. Toiletries offered were lacking the quality of a 4* and were offered in plastic pump containers - a shampoo and body soap all in one out of a squeeze bottle in the shower and the plastic type sink had the feel of a 2* or 3* travel lodge not a 4* hotel The beds were extremely low down and we found the walls to be paper thin as heard the person in the next room snoring away. Only a single duvet provided - the bed was a small single each when we had booked a double! The air con worked great. While there is free hot drinks available down in reception - I think guests would prefer to have a kettle in their room for convenience as it's not great having to keep going down for a drink. On booking it also said chocolates were available with the hot drinks but nothing was even out during our stay. No bathrobe or slippers despite being advertised as being in the room on the in room info. No iron in the hotel either you had to ask - this was the feeling throughout that you had to keep asking for things. The customer shouldn't have to keep asking for items. On returning from being out sightseeing on the second day we asked at reception - do we need new passwords per 24 hours - no was the reply the ones we have will do the full stay. I also asked if hot items could be cooked to order as despite raising this issue with staff - the hot buffet items were cold - beans and scrambled egg aren't very nice cold! I was told you can't order anything to be cook - something we later found out too late that this can be done - why not promote it when asked then?! On the 24 hours mark of our stay the WiFi passwords stopped working again despite being told they would work for the whole stay so yet another trip down to reception - hardly convenient and rather annoying that again the wrong information was given to us when staff had been asked about services. The free WiFi when it worked was great but it was rather erratic and kept going off and I had to keep entering my password. The TV had a severe shortage of English channels. Mini bar in room was basic but they did offer you 1 bottle of free water (sparkling) At breakfast there isn't any system of being greeted and seated - it's a help yourself attitude - as it was busy both mornings we got to eat out breakfast on a make shift breakfast area with our table bang in the middle of several meeting rooms so I got a view of a wooden folding door and some coat hangers in the distance - it felt cheap and it looked it. I raised the issue of the hot items being cold - this didn't improve on the 2nd morning either which is a shame as a vegetarian I was limited to what I could have. The hotel can store luggage if required on check out - the hotel is set within a couple minutes walk from the metro look for the Am Borsigturm sign to exit at the closet bit. Approx 10 minutes away is a large lake - nice walk around it and water sports on offer. You can get the U6 metro straight into town - about 15 mins - useful to have correct change for the tickets 2.40 euros as these machines don't take Amex, Visa or MasterCard only Maestro! coins or some take notes...... Large shopping centre just over the road - supermarket selling cheap items, McDonald's over the road and plenty of eating places in the centre. All in all we felt this hotel was more a 3* superior than a 4* premier one .........it was clean, wasn't impressed with the breakfast set up in a conference room! if you can get a cheap rate I would stay here but not impressed there was no explanation on why I didn't get a double room?! Guests have to ask for things too much and even when doing so we were given wrong information on several occasions....Not great as a couple having to be split up in small single beds though....",Hotel_Review-g187323-d202454-Reviews-Hotel_am_Borsigturm-Berlin.html,2013-05-01T00:00:00,Clean & basic but lacking any wow factor,"This hotel is easy to get to from Tegel airport as you can take the frequent bus TXL 128 from outside the terminal until the metro station Kurt-Schumacher-Platz.

This hotel was easily reachable by taking a bus from the airport to Kurt Schumacher Platz. I forget the number of the bus, but this information is available by searching the web and was also available at the information booth at the airport. At Kurt Schumacher Platz we took the U6 subway to the Borsigwerke stop and when we got upstairs from the underground, the hotel was right there.

I don't think this was an unsafe area at all, and in fact across the street from the hotel is a police station. Check-in was easy. The room itself was quite nice. The quirky feature was that we slept on a waterbed. I don't know if this is common to every room in this hotel or not.

347,rpumpernickel,202454,Hotel am Borsigturm Berlin,"Could not have been better.................. I chose the Hotel am Borsigturm as I wanted to be fairly close to Tegel airport and, at the same time, near a subway station to get me into Berlin. The hotel is a very interesting structure being part of an office building taking up very little land yet provides about 100 bedrooms in a semi-circle on 5 floors. It offered everything and even more as I chose the special summer tariff at Euro 198.00 for 3 nights which includes a welcome cocktail, a bottle of Prosecco and a bottle of mineral water. The hotel also provides complimentary coffee, tea, soft drinks, hot chocolate on a 24 hour basis and you can enjoy a substantial and varied breakfast every morning until 10.00 am and until 12.00 am on the weekend. German papers are free and so are bicycles if you fancy a ride along Lake Tegel which is only around the corner. The service in the hotel is excellent, the staff is friendly and extremely helpful and if you came by car then they even provide a bucket with water, a sponge and a squeeze so you can clean your windscreen before you leave. Prices in the bar a very reasonably and even cheaper than in the traditional Berlin pubs and the bar stays open until well after midnight. The U6 station (Borsigwerke) is literally on the door step and the underground runs every 10 minutes right into the centre to Friedrichstrasse without having to change trains. All rooms have wireless internet and there a two computer and a printer in the lobby, all free of charge and part of the service. Tegel airport is about 4km away and easily reached by taxi (about 15 Euros) or by subway/bus. If you fancy to go out and have a traditional German or maybe Italian, Indian, Balkan etc meal then you find all these in Old Tegel which is one subway station away if you don’t want to walk it (15 minutes) Alternatively you could just walk over the road to the Shopping Centre ‘Borsighallen’ which has numerous eating places including a McDonalds and a large number of shops on 3 floors. In comparison to the prices charged in the United Kingdom this is a bargain which should not be missed and when I in Berlin next time I will most certainly go back to the Best Western Hotel am Borsigturm.",Hotel_Review-g187323-d202454-Reviews-Hotel_am_Borsigturm-Berlin.html,2012-08-01T00:00:00,Could not have been better..................,"I chose the Hotel am Borsigturm as I wanted to be fairly close to Tegel airport and, at the same time, near a subway station to get me into Berlin.

To see inside it you have to be 2m tall. Or stand on a chair. The breakfast buffet was excellent, with lots of types of meats and cheeses.

First off, I have zero idea how customers rate this place so highly. I have stayed at hotels around the world for very much the same nightly rate that were waaayyy better. Checking in was easy however. I did ask the receptionist for the WiFi passcode as soon as I got there because I needed to send an urgent email. She asked me to wait and took her 5 minutes preparing paperwork before she gave it to me. Disgusted!! Pros: Located in the heart of town. Most staff members seem polite and did say hi when we walked by. Hot water wasn't an issue in the bathroom. Cons: On boy! Way too expensive for what you receive. It is an older building with an old taste when it comes to decor. We were given room 411. This room is almost at the end of a dark corridor. They seemed to have made an effort to renovate the room but taste is simple. TV had gr8 channels though. We counted 6 windows facing the street which means that all other rooms (4 floors) all have windows facing their...yes! dark corridors. Our bathroom was that of a cheap motel. Careful though, if you open the small bathroom window, the other guests can peek from their tiny window. Everytime we showered, the tub would fill with water. It did drain but very slowly. Internet is horrible!! I was on vaca but still needed to send an email or two. It disconnected every 5 mins or so. Heater sounded like an old refrigerator and we could hear the tine 3 person elevator all day and night. There was also a extractor tube (from the kitchen) outside the bath window that rattled a bit during wee hours of the night. Then came my big disappointment. No iron in their rooms because they have had issues in the past according to their manager (who I believe is not a regular traveler). All hotel rooms this day and age have irons and if guests burn something, they pay for it and that's it. I needed to iron a formal shirt and jacket and had to pay for that. Breakfast is served up until 9:30am. Most hotels serve till 11am. We had two late tours and wanted to have BK later but had no choice. Breakfast overall was minimal.

It's in a great location, close to the main square. Check in seemed to be one of the most long winded I've experienced. They had my details all ready including a photocopy of my passport, as I'd stayed at the Royal Inca 1 prior to the trek, the room had been paid for in advance, however they insisted on a hotel voucher which the travel agent had never sent me. After some time I was able to obtain a voucher from the travel agent website to finally get my room, but it seemed without the voucher I wasn't going to get my room. The room itself was clean and tidy however had no windows at all so no natural daylight. It only seemed possible to get hot water in the bathroom in the evening. In the morning it was just cold water. I didn't get a great sleep at the Royal Inca 2 due to the bed being very hard, noises from 5am onwards from the kitchen and hearing the shower in the adjoining room. I may just have been unlucky with the room I had been given. Other rooms may be okay. The breakfast was good and one of female members of reception staff (unfortunately I don't know her name) was very helpful and couldn't do enough to help. A return taxi to the airport booked via reception costs 15 soles. This is a special rate for hotel guests, much cheaper than a normal taxi. Royal Inca 2 was a fair bit cheaper than Inca 1.

433,SteveBressi,318631,Royal Inka II Cusco Cusco Region,"Much Local Character and a Great Location Over the course of our tour, we stayed twice at the Royal Inca II in Cusco. When you enter the hotel, the ambiance is amazing. The hotel is furnished with many Inca items. When you walk through the lobby, you enter a indoor courtyard that includes the breakfast area, several sitting areas, a display including a Llama and Alpaca, and a large Mural on the wall. Of course, there was always complimentary coca tea available (much like many U.S. hotels have coffee on). The rooms are set around the indoor courtyard (much like an Embassy Suites in the U.S.) The rooms were good by Peruvian standards. The first room that we had (a double on the 2nd floor) was better apportioned that the triple that we had on the 4th floor when we returned. The rooms all had private baths, TVs, heat, reliable hot water and some rooms had WIFI depending on their proximity to the WIFI router. (The complimentary WiFi worked best in the indoor courtyard or on the walkways overlooking the courtyard). The rooms were equipped with hair dryers. The baggage service was excellent. The breakfast was the best of the places that we stayed in. This was the only hotel that included cooked to order omelets. The breakfast included a good variety of other items. including fruit. One thing not to miss is the observation deck on the roof. Take the elevator to the top (6th) floor and then it's just a short flight of steps to the deck. The deck has great views of the Cathedral and if clear - the glaciers. We got some great pictures here at sunset on a clear day. The deck is your only view of Cusco. The rooms have windows that open to the inside and include only a small high external window in the bathroom for air with absolutely no view. This was not an issue. The internal nature of the rooms meant that they were very quiet with absolutely no street noise. I was not impressed with the service at the front desk. We requested a second floor room at our return and there was no effort to accommodate us. The Royal Inca II's greatest attribute is its location. There are shops and a pharmacy within a few doors of the hotel that offer things that you may need. (We found it much less expensive to buy larger bottles of water in local stores than buy the water in the hotels). The hotel is also just a short walk to the Cathedral, the main tourist squares, many restaurants, and shopping. If coming from sea level, the 11,300 altitude takes about a day to adjust to with meds. Best to relax the day of check in - and you should feel much better the second day. Bottom line is that we enjoyed our stay at this truly Peruvian hotel. With regard to local hotels in the Andes, one should not expect the same amenities and reliability of services as their counterparts offer in the U.S. and Europe.

471,ANewPlaceEveryTime,318631,Royal Inka II Cusco Cusco Region,"Inka II a great place to relax after your your Inca Trek The Royal Inca II is a hidden gem in Cusco. Is one of two properties of the Royal Inca hotel group in Cusco. It is located close enough from the lively main square – the Plaza de Armas – but far enough to be quiet at night (just a five minute easy stroll from the front door to the Plaza). To insure we had a room on arrival we pre-booked a room at another hostel (lower class & futher out from the Plaza) for $50/night, but on arrival at the Cusco airport. We approached the Inca II hotel representative and negotiated a rate of US$60/night for two nights (Saturday night and Monday night). Normally the rooms here go in excess of $100/night, but if you’re lucky to be there in low season a better price can be had if you negotiate a little (it helps if you speak Spanish). The hotel occupancy was very small and we felt as if we owned the place. On the other hand, I could see difficulties finding sitting space at the restaurant & lobby during high season. Included with the room came a very nice breakfast which consisted of fresh fruits, fresh squeeze juices – orange & papaya, coffee, made to order omelets, bacon, cereals, and yogurt. What else could they have included in the breakfast, I don’t know. While you eat breakfast you’re presented with a view of a beautiful high mural made up of thousands of tiny tiles (see picture). At one end of the restaurant, sitting against the wall that separates it from the bar, the hotel always had a keg complimentary Hot Coca Tea. They say that this tea helps lower the effect of high altitude sickness. The Coca tea is a little bitter but it tastes great if you squeeze some lemons and add the honey that they had with it. Note: I was a little worry about the high altitude prior to my arrival in Cusco. All that I got was a slight headache. If you’re in decent shape, and don’t smoke, you don’t need to worry about it. They also said that the effect of high altitude is minimized if you do not eat heavy/fatty meals on your arrival. The room was adequate. You could say the furniture was dated – but this is common when you stay outside the cosmopolitan cities of Latin America. We had two decent twin beds with nice Alpaca blankets. The room has a decent 19 inch TV with more channels than one could watch on any given moment ( HBO, Cinemax, BBC, CNN, AXN, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, etc .). The shower was excellent and had plenty of hot water. But without a doubt for me the BEST amenity offered by the Royal Inca II is the Steam Room (note that they call it a Sauna, but is not a dry Sauna). The Steam roam is open every evening until 10pm. I am a huge fan of steam rooms, and the one at this hotel was perfect – Hot! The steam room felt AMAZING after we returned to Cusco having spent the day soaked, sweaty and dirty in Machu Pichu. Make sure to ask the attendant ( the massage therapist) to turn on the sauna at least 20 minutes before you intend to use it to warm up the tiles; unless you want to sit on cold tiles that will shock your rear end. They also have two Jacuzzis but I did not use them. As to food use the hotel restaurant only for breakfast. Instead take a five to ten minute walk and eat at Tapananchis. There are other restaurants around the Plaza de Armas which may have a more typical colonial décor ( Tapananchis is more cosmopolitan in its flair) But here the food was uniquely EXCELENTE!

Rooms were clean 2 small problems. We booked 5 rooms for 15 people, 3 to a room made it extremely crowded, very little room to put down and open luggage.Not impossible,and it made it very economical but 2 to a room would have been much more comfortable Temperature is centrally controlled. Some of the rooms were too warm. We asked if they could be made cooler but were told that wouldn't be possible. Upper rooms overlooking central courtyard were better with windows opened.

We are both students and didn’t have enough money for the flight tickets and also for a good hotel, so we decided to look for an alternative. “The Boutike Hostel” is a good option for young people, who likes to travel, because of the room prices and the youthful ambient. It is located in the main centre of Seville. This is a good point because you can go everywhere by walking, saving the money that you might spend in buses, trains or taxis. The other rooms are mostly occupied for young people too and the staffs of the hostel are nice, close and professional. Staying there two days, we felt like if we were at home, enjoying its’ living room with sofas, magazines and a tv and also the breakfast that you prepared yourself. “The Boutike Hostel” is a charming, original and familiar place inside the Seville’s historic city centre surrounded by full of bars, shops and crowded plazas. Having a beer with the typical “tapas” with cheese, ham and the rest of the typical food in Spain, the people meet there every evening. Seville is full of nice, close and funny people.

The building itself is a bit dated and tired but plenty of lovely stylish touches with the interior - although the website photos makes it look a lot more glossy that it actually is. We had a room with a balcony at the front, and at night were disturbed by noise from people on the street – not necessarily because there’s lots of people drinking or causing trouble, but more because of the acoustics of the street itself. Double glazing would probably help counter this. Juan and the girls on the front desk were really friendly and helpful, and Juan does great pancakes and waffles in the morning – but can get quite busy if there’s lots of people so one morning my boyfriend gave up on getting his pancakes as his order ended up being forgotten.

Well situated, less than 15 minutes walk from the main city centre sights and just round the corner from a great tapas place (Bar Alfalfa - try it!). Ask Juan to make his signature waffles for breakfast - they're great! Rolls and selection of jams, marmalade, too, plus decent coffee - a must in the mornings. The accommodation is fairly basic but at the price, not to be sniffed at. Not sure what it would be like in high summer, as there doesn't appear to be air con in the rooms. Also, if you're looking for a quiet place, you'll be out of luck. The concrete walls and floors mean you can hear everything at night (and I mean everything - including cases being rolled across floors, upstairs taking a pee or couples checking out the bed springs!) It's on a quiet street but if you're at the front, the narrow and tall sides of the buildings funnel any traffic noise or talking, shouting, etc (lots at the weekends!) and the single glazing doesn't keep that out.

The breakfast buffet has a good choice with jam, bread butter, some cheese or cold meats, pancakes and cereal. We definitely recommend it, overall its a pleasant surprise and the staff is very friendly.",4,3,5,4,4,4,,,0.249166667,positive,4,1,1

706,globalistDc,229128,Fletcher Hotel Restaurant De Broeierd Enschede Enschede Overijssel Province,"surprisingly nice hotel We had a very nice 5-night stay at this hotel in July 2013. I was concerned about the hotel's location 4 km away from the center of Enschede -- but it turned out to be right across from a stop for a bus that runs into town regularly and was a 10-minute walk from the Enschede Drienerlo train station. The hotel is a set of older A-frame buildings set back from the road and tucked under a canopy of trees. Our room was a weird two-level affair. The first floor had a small sitting area, bathroom and small balcony. Then there was a steep staircase up to the bedroom in the peak of the A-frame. It was pretty hot up there at night without air conditioning; we heard from other guests that their rooms had ceiling fans, but ours did not. Oddly, housekeeping didn't fully clean the room on a daily basis: the bathroom was cleaned and the beds were made, but they didn't vacuum (which we could see from leaf debris which blew in through the windows), nor did they wash the cups or replace the coffee and tea. Breakfast in the bistro was WONDERFUL: eggs, bacon, juices, all sorts of coffee (drip, expresso, cappucino, cafe creme, etc.), fruit, cheese, cold cuts, yogurt, granola, pastries, etc. -- all fresh and nicely arranged. The stylish restaurant open for dinner has a creative menu of small-portioned dishes, to encourage people to order starters or salads and/or desserts as well as a main course. Everything we tried was out-of-this-world, especially the gazpacho with cucumber foam (wow) and strawberries Romanov. The staff in both the bistro and restaurant were super friendly and efficient, and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. This is a big part of what made the stay unexpectedly nice. The only downside of our visit was the thinness of the walls of the bedroom. One night we could hear details of a couple, er, coupling from 1-3am -- where pillows over our heads did nothing to muffle the sounds.

Loved that there were bicycle rentals onsite, and that the rate was very reasonable (especially considering the convenience). The restaurant is decent, and lunch is well-priced. I did not try dinner. Desk staff friendly and attentive. Housekeeping was alright; I found that my bed was half-made most of the time, by which I mean that it definitely looked slept in, and usually just had the covers pulled up. I did like that they wait until 10am or so to make up the rooms. All in all, would definitely stay again and was definitely an acceptable value.",4,5,3,4,4,3,,,0.155827381,positive,4,1,1

The front lobby staff are wonderful. I arrived quite early and they quickly rearranged rooms so that I could check-in to a room and relax after a very long trip. They assisted with other arrangements, and help pass along information to colleagues staying at the hotel. In short, the service was wonderful and I always felt like they were trying their very best to look after their guests. The rooms are very comfortable. I had a loft room with a work area, balcony (nice view over the green space at the rear of the hotel), and washroom on the main floor, and then a bedroom up a steep flight of stairs. There are televisions on both floors, and separate adjustments for heat (which was handy since it was quite cool). The room is well-designed and very comfortable. The only flaw is the need to go down steep steps to find the washroom in the middle of the night, and I would not want navigate the stairs after a few too many glasses of wine. The breakfast buffet is quite good - essentially the usual mix of hot and cold items that you find at good hotels through the region. I have a computer that can only connect to the internet via wifi, and I was a little disappointed to find that I could only access wifi in the breakfast area or lobby (wired connections available in the rooms).

It is easily accessible by train (walking distance from the train station). I had a two-floor room with only a small hall downstairs as well as a balcony and a large and clean bathroom. There was the “bedroom” upstairs with two comfortable beds. The wardrobe was downstairs. The stairs were very steep and that created some difficulty in going down in the middle of the sleep if you have to use the bathroom. The weather was very cold when I was there and the heating radiators were kept closed at all times. You have to turn them on when you go into the room. But you find them turned off again as you go out and come back. It takes time for the room to get warmer. The mini bar is empty. I had to pay 5.5 Euros for a bottle of water.

It is easily accessible by train (walking distance from the train station). I had a two-floor room with only a small hall downstairs as well as a balcony and a large and clean bathroom. There was the “bedroom” upstairs with two comfortable beds. The wardrobe was downstairs. The stairs were very steep and that created some difficulty in going down in the middle of the sleep if you have to use the bathroom. The weather was very cold when I was there and the heating radiators were kept closed at all times. You have to turn them on when you go into the room. But you find them turned off again as you go out and come back. It takes time for the room to get warmer. The mini bar is empty. I had to pay 5.5 Euros for a bottle of water.

The pool was great, warm enough with beautiful views across the city, into the distant mountains and closer views of intriguing allotments that scale the steep sides of the nearer mountains - swam to the sounds of chickens clucking and scratching peacefully. We ate in the hotel that night. The waiters were charming and courteous, as I said, old fashioned service, the menu was great value - not haute cuisine, but good. The only thing I didn't like was the music choice - a bizarre mix of soul, guitar shredding, and pop garbage - some jazz, or quiet classics?

Our room (the last available - obviously popular hotel) was dated (but I like dated) very clean, great bed, and with a charming balcony (room, not the bed) with a palm tree scene painted under the balcony above, circa date of hotel - 1940. The pool was great, warm enough with beautiful views across the city, into the distant mountains and closer views of intriguing allotments that scale the steep sides of the nearer mountains - swam to the sounds of chickens clucking and scratching peacefully. We ate in the hotel that night. The waiters were charming and courteous, as I said, old fashioned service, the menu was great value - not haute cuisine, but good. The only thing I didn't like was the music choice - a bizarre mix of soul, guitar shredding, and pop garbage - some jazz, or quiet classics? Breakfast the next morning was indeed copious; a brilliant buffet including the 'kit' to make 'Pan con tomate' loads of ham, cheese, fruit, toast, cakes, etc, etc . . . my partner didn't rate the coffee however. I drink tea so couldn't comment. Brilliant place.",5,5,,,5,,,,0.417598639,positive,5,1,1
818,MattDildon,633405,Hotel Pyrenees Andorra la Vella Andorra la Vella Parish,"Greatest hotel in Andorra! I have visited in Andorra four times now. Latest trip in august of 2015 me and my wife stayed in Hotel Pyrenees. Best move we could make. Also this was our honeymoon. First of all the location of the hotel is great. Not in the main street, but really close to everything you could possibly want in Andorra. We went with a car and hotel Pyrenees offers their own parking garage for use for 15€/day. That's an offer you can't refuse because if you have ever been in Andorra then you know how people drive there and the parking garage saves your car from any harm. First time I was in Andorra and left my car in an outside parking facility, somebody drove into it, didn't leave a note and just took off. I paid that one myself. So take the garage. The hotel cost 80€/night and included the fantastic breakfast. There was always something good to eat in there. Also the staff were working really hard so the restaurant was really clean and the buffet was always full of food. Our bags were carried to our room and everybody in the staff were super nice! Everybody spoke excellent english. One of the best staff's I have ever seen in a hotel anywhere in the world. The room was comfortable and quiet. The we were in the room 202 that had a balcony to the street. At the first night there was a birthday party in a bar down the road and the noises kept us up for an hour from 00:00 to 01:00 but the.it stopped and we got a good nights rest. We did sleep with the balcony door open because the mountain air is so fresh. Great bathroom with a bidet and a bathtub. Really clean and everything looked brand new. No hair dryer but there was one in the reseption that they loan if you just ask. Really comfortable bed and great pillows. There were no power outlets by the bed which was a bit strange but there were a few by the tv across the bed. There is a pool and a tennis court in the top of the parking building. The pool was awesome and the view was really awesome! There are also some sun chairs up there. It was really something. Only problem was that there was a chicken farm really close in the side of the mountain and a rooster used to yell a lot while sunbathing. First time I've experienced that before. I thought it was funny. The shopping street is just after you leave the front door. Restaurant and all the shops in the world are really close by.

International coach terminal is a fifteen-minute-walk away. Breakfast is pretty good including several kinds of sausages and cheese, fresh croissants, bread (toasts), juice, yogurt and coffee/tea. The room is kept clean at all times. The staff at the front desk is very friendly. My single room (#220) was very small. Besides the bed there was a TV, a clothes hanger, a little table and a chair. The only window opened on a inner courtyard that was only a couple of square meters large. You never get sun light in the room. I would've preferred a room with a street view but maybe all single room are just like this. The most unpleasant thing was lack of any noise insulation. I could hear everything happening in my neighbor's rooms. Luckily, I sleep soundly and it was not a big deal. However, for someone, it can be a real problem. Finally, the price-quality ratio is very good.

There was a very wide selection of cold meats, cheeses, cereals, breads etc., and for a supplement you could have bacon & eggs if you wished.

It seems like a hotel from the 1940's but in a good way. It's very clean and my room was recently totally remodeled. The prices are very reasonable and they provide excellent service, even a bellboy! I found the hotel is actually slightly away from the center of the town, especially the main shopping centers, but that was actually a positive for me. There are several restaurants within walking distance. Be sure you hike the well-maintained stone path up the hill behind the hotel. It's rather steep at first with many steps, but eventually leads to a level trail that rings the hillside overlooking the town which provides some beautiful views. The level stone path is next to a swiftly flowing stream for irrigating the tiny plots of cropland along the hillside. It was truly breathtaking.

The hotel dates back to the 1940's - and thus the rooms are quite small. I imagine that, even with updating, there is not much one can do to change the size of the rooms. With that said, we booked a ""superior"" room and had a small balcony (the round balconies, facing the street) and had recently been redone. The room was small, but lovely in details (wifi was great, refrigerator, nicely bathroom). We had printed a map to help us arrive at the the hotel and I am still not sure how we found it. Andorra la Vella is a crazy mess of streets and cars and somehow we happened upon the right street. We were on a motorbike, so we parked in a moto spot just past the hotel for check in. If you have a car, be watchful for the hotel as there is a dedicated spot just BEFORE the hotel for parking to check in. When it is time to actually park, you must backtrack a block and enter the underground parking. The staff will help you navigate. (Also, we booked right through the hotel website and received free motorbike parking). What sets this hotel apart is the wonderful attention from the staff -- truly service oriented and very kind. Breakfast was a lovely spread of food (the typical jamon, cheese, bread, fruit, yogurt, etc...) in the hotel restaurant. We also had dinner at the hotel restaurant (it was pouring out...who wants to go anywhere??). The set menu was great -- several choices and changes weekly.

895,Suitcasewheel,633405,Hotel Pyrenees Andorra la Vella Andorra la Vella Parish,"Great location, good value for money, good restaurant I was driving through Andorra and thought I'd stop for the night and sightsee a bit before proceeding to Spain. The hotel turned out to be very centrally located next to Old Andorra la Vella, the old center of the capital. The hotel itself is very ""shiny"", everything is polished and sparkles. When checking in I was told that although I had booked a single room they were upgrading me as it was not high season and it was their policy to upgrade customers to better rooms when they could. I got a room on the floor above the reception facing the street with a shared balcony. But the street is the main street, you can't really open the balcony door or stand out there for long.

The only moment we could have drinks at the pool was on Saturday afternoon when the restaurant was also open. The girl Servíng us made a mess out of the order. Which was not a difficult one it contained a Certain amount of lemonades fries coffee and water. Besides for the poor pool service a great place to stay ! I would suggest having a full Pool service or allow your guests to bring their own drinks and snacks to the pool. Or put up a vending machine where you can at least get something near the pool or make some stuff available at the reception around the corner.",,,,,,,,,0.211738095,positive,4,1,1

(2) housekeeping was very stingy with towels - there were three of us and the original reservation was for two so they kept giving us exactly two towels even though we would ask for three (3) the living room gets hot during the day, there should be a ceiling fan to compensate for no AC in the LR (4) all towels were old and used, like gym towels. They really need to replace them (5) the mattress and pillows were hard and uncomfortable (6) the food at the bar was mediocre, worse spot in Jan Thiel (7) most important, the resort is far back and a good walk to the beach.

922,luv2travcal,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Some Good - Some Bad The Papagayo Hotel is in an excellent area with a many restaurants and a grocery store next door. It was our first time on Curacao and we really enjoyed the island except for the heavy traffic. We spend various trips on Bonaire, so we were not used to the traffic jams and various strikes that are conducted at some ""round abouts"" that will have you stuck for a while. I will list the good and bad: Good: Location, housekeeping, amenities, air conditioning and some front desk staff. Bad: Very small rooms, bad looking floors, shared balconies with one other neighbor, bad septic smell near the pool and some front desk staff. We booked an ocean front room, but some of these rooms have views of the busy beach club, so they were not very private and did not have great views as we were expecting, especially on the second floor. Our main view was the lighted Papagayo logo. The picture from the website is from the third floor and shows an unobstructed view. The shared patio with a small glass separator can be annoying. The first couple of days, the person staying next to us would go out and play music while face timing someone while talking loud when we would want a peaceful morning hearing the birds and eating breakfast. The second part of our stay we had two heavy smokers next door and my wife has allergies to tobacco smoke. When we checked in, we asked for an electrical converter plug since we were told through an email that they were available. After asking, they said they were all out and that I can purchase one at the store next door. Later when we saw a sign for an ice maker, we searched but could not find it. After asking the front desk where it was at, we were told there is none and we would have to ask the front desk for ice. Why not take down the sign? Why not at least say ""I'm sorry about the confusion"" not a cold manner response that was given us? There were some staff that were all smiles and friendly, especially the evening/night staff. I think the hotel tries to do well and sometimes it is not easy to oversee all of the staff and they have a big operation to run and breakdowns will happen. Would we stay there again? No. Would I recommend it to others?

I have blue eyes and blonde hair so I was mistaken for dutch - no big deal! But just know that it is mainly dutch when you get there, but most still speak english. There is a dutch grocery store located within the hotel, which was so convenient!! We were able to get snacks for the hotel and cereal for breakfast. The food we had at the resort restaurants were great, however VERY expensive. We did not take into consideration just how expensive these restaurants would be.

I stayed at the Papagayo hotel (there is also a Papagayo resort). I loved the minimalistic design of the hotel, I believe it may be one of the only design hotels on the island. The room was very spacious. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The hotel had 2 pools on the beach front; one smaller with chlorine and one large natural pool with a sand bottom. I also picked this hotel because it had a gym. I was quite impressed by this gym as many hotel gyms can be quite small and basic. This gym has a decent amount of cardio machines of all sorts, two sets of free weights, squat racks and muscle specific machines. It was spacious and definitely had sufficient machines and weights to continue your gym regime. I went in March and it felt like I came in the low season which I personally enjoyed, I think only a third of the beach beds were in use. If you want to visit other beaches on the island, as there are many beautiful ones, you definitely need to rent/hire a car.

963,JetSetter727,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Why does Papagayo want to expose me to identity theft? Papagayo is a beautiful hotel with great potential that repeatedly ruins the experience with terrible service. During my last stay there I stayed in my room more than usual, since it was almost always raining. Yes, Curacao had non-stop rain for nearly a week. Trying to make the best of it, I tried to take naps and rest a lot. This is where the trouble started. The cleaning staff comes in once to clean. Then their supervisor knocks 2 hours later to check the result. I was desperate to take a nap. They had a ‘Do Not Even Think About Knocking’ sign. I put that out. I got a call 40-50 mins later from reception saying something along the line “we saw the do not disturb sign but we just wanted to make sure if your really meant it”. Something like that. I thought it was some kind of cruel joke. But I guess they really were serious. They call sleeping guests to confirm that they really want to be sleeping. This is an example of bad service. So I used their internal feedback web site and reported (very politely) that they are not letting me take naps. In the mean time it was raining almost all the time. There was not much else to do. They seemingly acted very professional about it. I was rewarded with a “20% discount on your next stay’” card when I left. By the time I got home I got an email thanking me for my feedback and all of reservation and the front desk were cc-d. Wow. Maybe they do care!? (Read on to see what actually happens when I try to use this gift.) Unexpectedly, I had a week gap at work, and I thought this was the time to use this kind offer. That’s when I met the meanest person from reservation. I wrote an (again very polite) email to her asking for availability and sending my personal info for the reservation. She responded with an email saying three things: 1. She lectured me for misspelling her name, although she got my name wrong:-) 2. She chided me for not sending a screenshot (!) of me entering my sleep complaint into *their own* website — like they didn’t have access to their own website 3. She told me that she won’t take cc info over the phone if I want the 20% discount. I must send it via email. — so if I don’t like that, I guess, I might as well get lost. Thanks a lot for the gift! That is an example of bad service. I never send sensitive info over email so I called her and tried to make her understand that I would be exposing myself to identity theft if I emailed my cc info. I asked her if there was any other way, holding my card in my hand trying to make a $3000 purchase. She said I had to email it, because I might be using a stolen credit card (!) if I give it over the phone. She said that to a repeat customer of 10+ times at the hotel who has always payed all his bills. I don’t steal credit cards, lady! She was talking to me in a very inappropriate tone. That is an example of terrible service! The one thing all conversations at this hotel lack is “I’m sorry”. If they just said it once I would not be nearly as annoyed. But they have to be always right and the guests have to be always wrong. Eventually, I decided not to make the reservation because protecting myself from fraud was more important. To find some info on how dangerous emailing cc info really is, one just needs to do a simple search on Google “email credit card risk”, then read the first few results. It’s extremely high risk. Some other hotels may ask for this if you don’t mind the risk but they always offer alternatives like calling it in, wiring money, using FAX or secure web forms, all of which are much more secure.

Overall we had a nice vacation. We are a couple in our 60's looking for a quiet relaxing getaway. The staff at the resort were friendly and helpful. We liked the open air concept of the villa. There was plenty to do and we enjoyed several meals at ZEST. The daily maid service was appreciated. The kitchen in the villa was adequate but a regular coffee pot would have been nice (we don't drink espresso) and it was rather sparse are far as cooking utensils, bowls, etc We choose a resort with a kitchen as we cook most of our meals in the unit. The air conditioning was fine in the bedroom but I would expect a queen or king mattress in a 4 star resort. The furniture in the villa was very uncomfortable. You could not rest your head or back up against anything unless you moved up against the wall or post outside. The location of our villa was near the back gate. I don't know if you can request the location but it was at least a half a mile walk to get to the beach and steep hills on the return walk. There were many evenings we would have liked to have gone back down to the beach but could not walk anymore. It might be nice to have some kind of shuttle several times a day to the beach especially for people in the back villas. We walked an average of 2.5 miles a day. The exercise is nice but a little excessive. Even a car does not help as there is limited parking down by the beach mid day. The pool by the reception area was closer and having a beautiful area for children and there parents is a great concept put it was rarely used.

974,melinlyon,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Beautiful place, mixed experience We recently spent 10 days at Papagayo over Christmas and while the experience was overall very positive there were many small issues with room for improvement. I am giving them 4 stars but if 3.5 had been an option, that would be a more accurate rating. What makes me push it to 4 rather than 3? 1) It is an amazingly beautiful place with lushly landscaped grounds and stylish architecutre and 2) the people who work there do, for the most part, try hard to please despite the many issues with the resort. Arriving at the resort, where we had booked a 2 bedroom ocean-view villa for 10 days, we were given the keys and shown on a resort map where to find our accommodation. I was surprised by the fact that the staff left us to discover the villa on our own; I would have expected to have been personally shown around our unit. It took me several days to figure out how certain things ie the oven worked (eg. as both a microwave and a toaster oven). The villa itself had a few surprising features: the folding louvered doors are like shutters that you unlock and slide along a metal rail to open; it's not super easy to figure out how to do this. There are no actual windows - when the shutters are open the living space extends outside to the wraparound deck. This is a lovely feature but it explains why mosquitoes can be an issue (this wasn't a problem for us) and also why the villa got so hot. Overall we were quite happy with the design of the villa but those doors were a bit annoying to open and close whenever we came and went. The food package we had arranged for the first day was not delivered. We returned to reception who said they could still deliver it; it got there later that evening but seemed to contain a mish-mash of items without certain basics like tea bags. The next morning we were out early enjoying breakfast on the deck when the watering system turned on and sprayed smelly recycled water all over the table. It was simply a badly oriented hose pipe but we had to call and wait for a couple of hours before anyone came to fix it. The next day the 'fix' stopped working so we went into the garden and adjusted it ourselves. On the third day we began noticing a great many tiny ants in the kitchen area. I pointed this out to the cleaner who did a deeper clean of the counters and sprayed with bug spray. The next day the ants returned. I spoke to reception who promised to do something about it. Nothing happened. Returned the next day and spoke to someone who seemed a bit more responsive, and who explained that they would need to remove everything from the kitchen, including all our foods, fumigate and that we would need to be out of the villa for several hours. Fine, I said, agreeing to be out the following morning. Cleared out the kitchen and returned later that afternoon to find nothing had been done! Went back, complained, and eventually after further confusion it got taken care of the following day. No more ants but we did smell the insecticide for several days. I do get that this is the Caribbean and that bugs happen, but the guest service and follow up was really rather spotty. As for the resort itself, it should be noted that Papagayo is run like several separate establishments at Jan Thiel Beach. There is the resort, where we stayed, which has its own reception, restaurant and outdoor pool. There is the hotel with access to the main restaurant, bar and beach area with infinity pool by the ocean. And there is the plaza with a fitness club. As resort guests, we were automatically given access to the beach chairs (although no one ever checked our passes). This area is crowded and fairly noisy, although there is also private pool with seats for guest only. Regrettably only towards at the end of our stay did we discover the more laid back 'Koko's' private beach at the other end of Jan Thiel (5 min's walk). Not part of Papagayo but at 10 naf for a beach chair well worth it to get away from the music and people! At no time was the overall resort with its different features presented to us. We just had to figure it out. As for the health club, it was annoying to access and we were not made to feel welcome. In order to go, you must ask for a voucher from the resort reception for each visit. On arriving, the greeting from the owner was: ""You do know if you want to come back, you'll need another pass?"" Then, no access was given to change rooms or showers as we did not have member's cards. We were told to change in the toilet. Yuck. Needless to say, I did not return. Restaurant-wise, aside from the bar which was very well run, we went to the Beach Club restaurant twice and enjoyed the food but found the service to be spotty and overall very slow. Any of the other restaurants in the area beats them for service and food quality was pretty good. For really good meals, the best options are in Willemstad, if you're willing to do the 30 minutes drive. The Jan Thiel plaza shopping centre had a good food shop which was convenient, well-stocked and fresh, despite the fact that prices were a bit higher than the shops in town.

I am giving them 4 stars but if 3.5 had been an option, that would be a more accurate rating. What makes me push it to 4 rather than 3? 1) It is an amazingly beautiful place with lushly landscaped grounds and stylish architecutre and 2) the people who work there do, for the most part, try hard to please despite the many issues with the resort. Arriving at the resort, where we had booked a 2 bedroom ocean-view villa for 10 days, we were given the keys and shown on a resort map where to find our accommodation. I was surprised by the fact that the staff left us to discover the villa on our own; I would have expected to have been personally shown around our unit. It took me several days to figure out how certain things ie the oven worked (eg. as both a microwave and a toaster oven). The villa itself had a few surprising features: the folding louvered doors are like shutters that you unlock and slide along a metal rail to open; it's not super easy to figure out how to do this.

I also have plans for the Spa and beach tomorrow. The water is wonderful, they have created amazing areas to swim, snorkel and dive; they even have a sunken ship to dive down to. There are plenty of beach chairs to be had for a small fee; covered or open to the Caribbean sun. If you’re hungry, lots of food options around from beach snacks to sit down casual dinners.

I actually changed my resort twice prior due to this issue. After reserving, although my airline informed them, I called Papagayo about a week later to remind them I would need a handicap room. I called after that to ensure they knew. I was basically told I could request it. Request it? Like it's an upgrade? We reserved a decent villa in the RESORT. It was not handicap access by any means. I asked if I could upgrade to something closer to the water in the HOTEL, I was told ""None of the rooms were clean"".... lol... This was around 2100 hours. We would not be allowed out of our contract that night with Papagayo Resort. We wanted to go someplace else. Was told we had to wait til the morning supervisor came in. First morning, husband got up and saw how far we actually were from the beach (arrived in dark). It is all hills and a 2 lane road to cross over for the Jan Thiel Beach (public). He went and rented a car because he knew I was never going to be able to get up and down the hills and the distance was certainly not beachfront or even close. There is no RESORT transportation. The Papagayo Hotel is past the Jan Thiel Beach. It is waterfront. That is the only beach in front of a Papagayo location. The bi-folding doors that surround the villa are very pretty but, unfortunately, let literally everything in. Each of my daughters (19/22) had 21-25 bug bites (sand fleas? Mosquitoes?). This was because the air was stagnant if you closed the villa doors to keep bugs out. We opened them thinking the breeze would help. It helped the bird build a nest in the lighting fixture in the living room, where a ceiling fan would have done a world of good. We had to stay in our bedrooms as they were the only rooms air-conditioned in the villa, away from the bugs and it was extremely hot and humid at night during our visit. If you like the desert and love a breeze, this is your place. We prefer to be pampered and in air conditioning with enough pillows and towels I need. The thought we had to rent a car - I specifically called PAPAGAYO to inform them I could not walk far and it went in one ear and out the other. Customer Service supervisor, Barbara, could not do anything to accommodate us and acted like she really had no sympathy for us and blew us off. This area is large. Everything is pretty far away from each other and there is no transport offered publicly or by the resort that I know of. To expect a vacationer to have to walk this hill and walk back with your beach items or could not be done with someone with limitations. There was no ""disability"" act here! You also need ac/dc converters for all of your items - they don't sell them so we spent 2 hours looking for converters. Also, all brochure photos depict flat ground. It couldn't be anything further. Remember, there are two different hotels - there are the villas (RESORT not beachfront at all) and the HOTEL (beachfront). We reserved the villas - needed a car to get to beach. The hotel on beach would have made us very happy, paying the difference. ice is everything and the customer is right. Not here. I couldn't wait for this vacation.

The apartment was comfortable but could have a refurb / painting job. 5 min walk to the Jan Thiel beach area, nice place with lots of facilities and from the 1st of November beach beds were free of charge which Was great. Pool area at the resort was also very convenient. Complements to the staff who were very helpful and friendly. Point of attention is the possibility of late check out, we only got clarity that it wasn't possible for us the night before we left. Would be better to know some days in advance. Would definitely return.",,,,,,,,,0.255882353,positive,5,1,1

We rented a car (and got a GPS) and easily traveled around the island. The views are beautiful and the resort looks great. There are numerous restaurants that share the same stretch of beach so there are enough choices for food within walking distance. Zest was especially good. The on-site grocery store is a nice extra. You can easily pack some food and drinks and head out for the day. The not-so-good: We chose the hotel, in part, because it is advertised as adults only. It may be that the rooms are adults only, but the villas are not and there were kids everywhere. Just a different vibe than expected. When we arrived they were out of beach towels. We were able to get them by the middle of the following day, but a beach resort without backup towels? And to get fresh beach towels, you have to go to the reception desk and trade in the old ones. It's not like that was a huge deal, it was just an annoyance. Also, we had to pay to rent chairs by the pool that offered service, which seems odd given that we were already paying to stay at the resort. We opted to rent chairs at Zest instead a few times because they were more comfortable and the service was better.

Upon arrival we checked in and we were asked how many people were in our group we said 5, and the women checking us in said we had only reserved a 2 bedroom villa for 2. My sister in law and I split the cost so we reserved under our names. The 2 bedroom 2 bath villa accommodates 5 people so we didn't think anything of it. We were then told Papagayo charges per person, no where In Expedia did it mention that and it's not an all inclusive, so I was a bit annoyed and bothered. The women proceeds to tell us we have to pay an additional $800! After we already paid $1,000 for a 6 night stay, I was irate! I asked why the extra charge their website clearly states it accommodates 5 people. To which the women says ""we have to pay for the extra electricity"", mind you you the villa only has air conditioner in the rooms and strict rules to turn off when you wake up! !! So I don't see where the extra electricity would come from. The women proceeds to call the manager, then comes back and says sorry the manager said you have to pay, the manager doesn't have the decency to come the first time, after a 10 minute back and forth we ask go speak to the manager again, which the women doesn't know where she is at. The manager was a tad bit pleasant but I felt like I was speaking to a wall. She lacked customer service and still couldn't prove my point that the 2 bedroom 2 bath villa accommodates 5 and they only time you should be charged is if you exceed that amount, she proceeds to blame it on Expedia.

Our villa was very clean and spacious with modern appliances and furniture. Although only the bedrooms had AC, the gentle breeze was adequate to keep the place comfortable. My only complaint is the voltage in the villa was 220V and although adapters were provided no transformers are available. This should be made clearer in brochure. Also, no shuttle is available to transport you beyond the property to the beach or supermarket as advertised. The on site restaurant was nice, but the choices at the Beach Club are better.

1034,lakeviewandsunsets,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Great place to relax if you need down time My friend and I stayed at the resort for one week with a sea view. We each had our own bedroom and bathroom which worked perfect for us. The veranda was large and comfortable with a nice breeze. Each bedroom had air conditioning. We went to the local grocery store which was within walking distance to pick up food for breakfast and lunch and wine. We enjoyed the food in the local restaurants and walked to one approximately 20 minutes away called Pop's and the food was also good. The spa was excellent. Orientation Suggestion: The resort needs to provide guests with an orientation upon arrival or first thing the next morning (general information on the grounds, suggested tour groups, where to eat, where is the grocery store, what is available at the beach, where to get the bus, taxi service available, where to rent a car, any special events taking place when they are visiting). Update the a website: Review what is listed as the information is misleading. For example there is no beach where you can walk along in the water, you need an adapter, etc. Visitors should know what to expect when they arrive. The local people we met in Curacao were friendly and helpful. We were told by a few of the locals not to be alone in town especially at night, be aware of your surroundings at all times, do not leave anything unattended, and do not stop if anyone asks you for money.

1035,nich_48,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Not impressed We stayed at the villa in 119 which faces the street with ocean view but noisy with traffic and people walking by. Stayed Jan 3 to Jan 9,2015. After check in we asked to be switched over to their hotel property and were advised the manager would contact us the next day to advise if there was anything available but we never got a reply. The information sheet provided at the villa states there is a ceiling fan in the living room which does not exist so I sent an email regarding this and never got a reply so I asked at reception about this and if we could get a floor fan and her reply was she didn't think so. They should update their information sheet to reflect changes and things not included as a result of their renovation. The main area is like a sauna so you need to turn up the air-conditioning in the bedrooms and leave the doors opened to cool off the living area, If there is a breeze you can open the back door and the doors leading to the deck to cool off the area and then use bug spray as you will undoubtedly have mosquitos etc coming in. They state that this is eco friendly so when they renovated they should have put in ceiling fans since the wiring would have already been installed, this would help circulate the air and minimize the cost of air-conditioning. The shower looks nice but not functional, there was no shelf to put your shampoo, soap so you have to put it on the floor. Also the floor in the shower is smooth and slippery when wet so you need to careful when getting out. The bed sheet in the master bedroom had a black stain and the towels did not look clean. Also if you use face cloths, they don't have any at the villa although at their hotel property they are provided. i usually travel with one but didn't take one as I thought that this was an upscale resort and was trying to minimize on packing . In the second bathroom there was a bath towel with a large yellow stain and some dark yellow gel like matter on the towel which was discovered after using the bath towel, Their laundry needs to be improved as i wondered at times if the towels were thrown in the dryer without being washed and put back in the rooms, I was disappointed with this property. When we inquired about this place on line it took forever to get a reply, i guess that should have been our warning. Service throughout Curacao is lacking. Also if you travel to any of the beaches keep your belongings with you as they are not safe even in a locked vehicle. Our experience with theft occurred at Daaibooi Beach in St. Willybrordus community. The 3 thugs were pretending to tend to their tire and broke into our van when we left for the beach. They stole 2 Go Pro cameras, prescription sunglasses and other miscellaneous items that were in a bright green Ed Bauer back pack . We left the beach and found the car parked at a local store not far from this beach. We asked the 2 older men at the store if they knew the 3 thugs but of course they replied that the did not but I know that was a lie . There is a house behind the store which is where they probably were hiding or living . The car was a black Mitsubishi Lancer with faded paint, rough looking vehicle.

Please note this time of the year it can rain, but not that havy though. Downside of this period are the mosquitos! :( The park was originally meant as a real-estate project for sales.....but when that wasn't succesfull, the current owners bought the whole project and created the resort. NOTE: this is the ""old"" papagayo beach resort and NOT the new papagayo beach HOTEL. (same owners but totally different) This resort is like a park with vilas/bungalows, the new hotel beach-front is a real hotel with Miami-style design (and more expensive) Good, now the bungalows, they are ok, especially during the day when there are no mosquitos. Reason are the open windows and spaces on the great porch! Outside the rainy season this is really great! There are 2 bedrooms, and 2 bathrooms (no bath!). The kitchen is open. They just placed some new furniture....ok, but not super ok. The beds are relatively good. I would say all is a 3,5* The bungalows offer quitte some privacy! You can park your rental car in front of the house. Now the beach; it's named the Jan-Thiel beach with Zanzibar beach club, and the Papagayo beach club (in front of the beach hotel). It takes about 5-8 minutes by foot from your bungalow (you can also drive if you have problems walking). There are lots of events, lots of bars and restaurants. There is no real sand-beach. They created a very small beach and a beach-looking-infinity pool. There is a pool at the resort, and a small kids-pool. Not extremely popular though due to the nearby beach. There is a fitness club, a supermarket and sushi restaurant. Next to the resort Chogogo resort can be found (slightly cheaper and less comfortable) The restaurant at the hotel is OK, but I would suggest other restaurants nearby, such as ZEST or the Kleine Wereld. Also very good with true local food, restaurant Rozendaels in front of Avila Beach hotel. Don't visit the Pirates nest - we got sick. Wifi is free, and speed is acceptable.

1038,4robinj,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Ok, but some comments I enjoyed a weeks stay in the Papagayo beach hotel. In general it was a very pleasant stay, however some points to keep in mind. The rooms located over/ near the lobby are quite noisy with noise from the lobby and the loading bay in the back, the other rooms seem to be better located though. The rooms look great and are well equipped, especially the illy coffee maker is a plus. The front desk team failed to impress. I booked an airport transfer on day one for my departure date. When confirming on the day prior to departing, there was no such record. In addition, the next day, both the wake up call scheduled for 5 am and the cab for 5.30 am where not arranged. It seemed a mistake as the security showed the log where the wake up call was scheduled for 7 am.. They took care of transportation quickly, but it's disappointing to experience 3 separate errors on one standard guest request. In general the front desk team provided adequate service, but they failed to impress and never took any initiative to stand out in their customer service experience, which in my opinion was due to a lack of leadership/ seniority in the team. The beach facilities provides great service, the furniture on the beach feels a bit tired and could do with some attention. The restaurant quality is quite good although slightly overpriced compared to similar restaurants on island. Staff was very friendly throughout the restaurants and provided fast efficient service.

1059,RickK82,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"large and cleveryly designed villa, had an excellent vacation These villas are really spacious and the clever folding doors to the large porch are a great feature. The doors are vented so there's a continuous draft trough the house. This is also why only the bedrooms are airconditioned, and in practice this works out really well. Beds are good too. Kitchen is very complete with dishwasher, microwaveoven, large fridge, lots of cutlery, actually anything you could wish for. Bathrooms are modern, spacious and in good condition, but I sort of expected a bath in at least one of them. Villas are positioned in a way that you have plenty of privacy on the porch, although the few villas near the entrance are bit less private and quiet. Welcome package is neat, really contains everything you need for your first night/morning. Both the restaurants on the resort and the beach club are great. Not exactly cheap but definitely value for money. Staff is help- and cheerful but sometimes a bit inexperienced and clumsy. Especially down at the beach club. I guess most of them are interns from Dutch hospitality schools. That said, everything seems to be well managed so there's very little to complain about. The resort looks great. Everything is well maintained and repairmen, cleaners and gardeners are constantly busy making sure everything keeps working well. Maids were very good too. Location is a bit remote, so if you want to see a bit more of the island you should really get a rental car (Budget is nearby and has good offers). The Jan Thiel beach itself is completely artificial, but modern and well designed, and everyone will be able to find his kind of beach and restaurant there. You could spend all of your holiday there, no problem. The visitors are mostly young Dutch families, so the whole place is crawling with toddlers and babies. As a couple without kids, this got on our nerves after a few days, so as long as we don't have kids of our own we'll look for a less child friendly place to stay.

Kitchen is very complete with dishwasher, microwaveoven, large fridge, lots of cutlery, actually anything you could wish for. Bathrooms are modern, spacious and in good condition, but I sort of expected a bath in at least one of them. Villas are positioned in a way that you have plenty of privacy on the porch, although the few villas near the entrance are bit less private and quiet. Welcome package is neat, really contains everything you need for your first night/morning. Both the restaurants on the resort and the beach club are great. Not exactly cheap but definitely value for money. Staff is help- and cheerful but sometimes a bit inexperienced and clumsy. Especially down at the beach club. I guess most of them are interns from Dutch hospitality schools. That said, everything seems to be well managed so there's very little to complain about. The resort looks great. Everything is well maintained and repairmen, cleaners and gardeners are constantly busy making sure everything keeps working well. Maids were very good too. Location is a bit remote, so if you want to see a bit more of the island you should really get a rental car (Budget is nearby and has good offers). The Jan Thiel beach itself is completely artificial, but modern and well designed, and everyone will be able to find his kind of beach and restaurant there. You could spend all of your holiday there, no problem. The visitors are mostly young Dutch families, so the whole place is crawling with toddlers and babies. As a couple without kids, this got on our nerves after a few days, so as long as we don't have kids of our own we'll look for a less child friendly place to stay.

Basically 2 bedrooms and 2 baths with kitchen and large shutters that folded open onto a huge deck. Even though the place was booked, the villas were laid out in such a way that you never felt like you were lacking privacy. The landscaping throughout the property was also superb with blooming flowers, cacti and other plants everywhere. A couple of words of caution- like a traveler before mentioned, we hit a Dutch holiday week and were the only Americans there. Breakfast staff basically ignored us and served Dutch families. The food was expensive anyway but we did not go back to eat there after that experience. Bought groceries and ate in. We did have dinner and service was more pleasant then. Front desk was pleasant enough but there was definitely a vibe we felt as far as not exactly loving Americans. The pool was crawling with little children all the time, and really not a very large pool. We definitely preferred going down to the beach. With your stay you get a pass for Jan Thiel beach which has nice swimming but is not your traditional beach. We absolutely would recommend renting a car and getting out of town to other beaches.

1073,capecodcrew,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Great Place for Families This resort made our trip, and our one regret is that we did not spend more time just hanging out there. Their website does not show how beautiful this place really is. The resort is located east of Willemstad, and most of the tourists were Dutch families. The resort is comprised of a series of Villas built into a mountainside overlooking Jan Thiel Bay. The grounds are beautiful and contain walking paths and gardens containing tropical plants and cacti surrounding each Villa. The gardens are inhabited by iguanas, parrots, and dozens of beautiful birds. Even though the resort was booked, we never noticed other people while we were in our Villa. It is like having your own private vacation house. Layout - The heart of each Villa is the wrap around porch. The two walls facing the porch slide open to create a vast open space stretching from the kitchen, through the living room area, to the porch. The porch contains comfortable cushioned chairs, a hammock, and a dinning table and chairs. Our kids spend their mornings on the deck feeding the birds, and we all loved to hang out together on the porch at night, under the stars, to share a few laughs. There are two bedrooms and two full bathrooms in each Villa. For $10 we had a third bed put into one of the bedrooms so that all three boys slept in one room and we had our own room. The showers were great and had plenty of pressure and hot water. This layout was perfect for our family. As we found out when we were researching this trip, there are very few places in the Caribbean that accommodate five people. This villa was perfect. The kitchen was also a bonus. We expected only the bare essentials, but the kitchen included a microwave, stove, refrigerator (great for keeping your Amstel Brights cool), utensils, knives, pots, pans, glasses, and plates (including kid’s plates and cups). As one other writer noted, there are small ants that do come into the kitchen, but as long as you keep the kitchen clean, this was not an issue (compared to your basic Maryland sugar ant, these things were downright harmless). Each bed was also equipped with a mosquito net, but we did not encounter any biting insects during our trip. (Our Villa was near the top of the hill and had plenty of wind, so that may have helped). Breakfast - We had a rate through Expedia that included breakfast. Breakfasts at the Seasons were very Dutch, and were both generous and delicious. There was a menu to choose from and breakfast included up to 3 coffees (their basic coffee is similar to an espresso, my wife ordered cappuccinos which were also included), or juices. They also have a separate children’s menu that included staples such as eggs or their version of a pancake, which is similar to a large crepe. The restaurant was not crowded in the morning, and many guests ordered breakfast to be delivered to their Villa. We, however, enjoyed sitting by the pool sipping many hot coffees. We did not eat dinner there, but dinners were well attended, and they had one of the more imaginative dinner menus on the Island. Other - The Pool was small but was fine for unwinding at the end of the day. The hotel has a towel service that they do not advertise. When you check in they give you a beach towel for each guest. You can switch beach towels once a day, and at the end of the day trade the towels in (they give you new towels or cards to use the next day). We did not know about this service and actually hauled beach towels with us from home because we knew we were going to be beach hopping. They also have a starter kit for the kitchen that contains some basic groceries, so check with them about the contents and price ahead of time.

Their website does not show how beautiful this place really is. The resort is located east of Willemstad, and most of the tourists were Dutch families. The resort is comprised of a series of Villas built into a mountainside overlooking Jan Thiel Bay. The grounds are beautiful and contain walking paths and gardens containing tropical plants and cacti surrounding each Villa. The gardens are inhabited by iguanas, parrots, and dozens of beautiful birds. Even though the resort was booked, we never noticed other people while we were in our Villa. It is like having your own private vacation house. Layout - The heart of each Villa is the wrap around porch. The two walls facing the porch slide open to create a vast open space stretching from the kitchen, through the living room area, to the porch. The porch contains comfortable cushioned chairs, a hammock, and a dinning table and chairs. Our kids spend their mornings on the deck feeding the birds, and we all loved to hang out together on the porch at night, under the stars, to share a few laughs. There are two bedrooms and two full bathrooms in each Villa. For $10 we had a third bed put into one of the bedrooms so that all three boys slept in one room and we had our own room. The showers were great and had plenty of pressure and hot water. This layout was perfect for our family.

1075,TwoWaterSigns,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Papagayo Resort a Wonderful Choice in Curacao This was our first trip to Curacao, although we have visited other Caribbean locales such as St. Barthelemy, Aruba, Belize. We chose The Papagayo Beach Resort near Caracasbaai (nothing is an easy drive from the airport however) on the southeast coast, based on other reviews, location, their website pictures, and price. What a wonder choice we made! The service from reception to check out was great! We have not always been so lucky, but everything was truly better than we anticipated. This resort is just across a cul-de-sac from Jan Thiel Beach, which is one of the larger beaches on Curacao. We visited 8 or 10 others that were more secluded (e.g. private), but lacked the full-service ammenities of Jan Thiel. But, every visitor should see other beaches! They are very pretty: Playa Forti, Playa Abou, Playa, Kenepa, Playa Kalki. The villas of Papagayo are larger than any accomodations we have had on other islands! Two bedrooms (air conditioned) with two baths and an expansive open air living space and enormous wrap around porch made this a fantantic choice. Though we were only two, the villa was large enough to easily accomodate two couples or two or three children. JUST SPECTACULAR! Oh, the resturant, Seasons, on property was exquisite! Our compliments to the chef and the wait staff there. Without a doubt, this is a place to stay again on a return trip to Curacao. Curacao itself is a paradise itself. It's small enough to explore by car (a jeep might be a better choice, but not a necessity), but large enought to keep a family busy for more than a week! And, if Americans are looking to feel that they aren't in the USA, this is another plus! No worries that you don't speak Dutch or Papiamento. The linguistic abilities of the Curacaoans and the Dutch workers and tourists shames those of us who bearly master the English language. This was nothing like the All-American feel of Aruba. We were definitley in another country! PLUS, the N.A. guilder is pegged to the US $, so there was no nastry EURO to devalue our own money.

The cottages were lovely-- stylish, simple and spacious. It took a while to get used to the defenestered main room, mainly because it took a while to adjust to the heat--evenings and mornings were fine (though mosquitos feasted on us at night--the resort did provide Off), but mid-day it was pretty uncomfortable. Thank goodness the bedrooms were air-conditioned! The linens were high quality and the beds comfy; the kitchen was fully appointed (though the fridge didn't work well, and we lost perishables as a result--upon duress, the hotel provided another fridge, though not without insisting that the original fridge was working fine--curdled milk that was warm to the touch to the contrary!) and we loved the wrap around porch; it was also nice having two bathrooms. On the downside, though we could partially see the ocean, we were hardly ocean front. Yes, the entrance to the hotel is across the street from Jan Thiel beach, but the cottages are set up an incline and the paths between them are winding--so for us to GET to and from the beach, it was a 10+ minute walk up or down a steep hill, in intense sun--lugging all of our snorkeling gear made this less than ideal. The hotel's pool, however, was fine and there was ample shade and lounging space. Seasons, the restaurant on sight, was wonderful, as was Zanzibar on Jan Thiel beach--in fact, we really didn't have a bad meal on the island.

1080,Scuba_Doc,240969,Papagayo Beach Resort Willemstad Curacao,"Great weather in February ! My wife and I, with our three children, just returned from a week at Papagayo Beach Resort. On their website they say that the electrical current is both 220v and 110v. This is not correct. They have only 220v service. So plan on taking your converter. They loaned us a converter, but it looked like it was 20 years old. It weighed over 40 pounds and had some exposed wiring to it. Also, be aware that they add a 6% service charge to your bill at checkout. This is not just bar and restaurant charges. They add a 6% service charge to your room charge, as well. This added almost $70 to our bill. Also, the Island has departure tax of $25 per person. Overall, we liked the Papagayo Beach Resort quite well. It was fairly easy to adapt to the open-air living room / kitchen. The one thing that would have been nicer would be if the master bathroom (which is of course attached to the master bedroom) had been air-conditioned. It was not. The window in the master bath had lattice slats and a screen. Leaving the bathroom door open would only serve to defeat the air conditioning in the bedroom. A 24"" x 18"" piece of plastic and 4 thumbtacks would close the bathroom window and allow the master bath to be air-conditioned. We did not have a small piece of plastic or 4 thumbtacks with us. As mentioned in a previous review the villas are exactly as pictured. It would be a good idea to stop at the grocery on the way from the airport. We ate at several nice restaurants while we were there. We liked the Zanzibar quite well. It is located directly across the street from Papagayo. We also liked the restaurant at Livingstone. Livingstone is a gated villa community immediately adjacent to Papagayo. Anyone considering Papagayo would want to look into Livingstone, as well. Our favorite restaurant in Willemstad was La Bahia. It’s in Otrabanda, right on the canal on the second level of the casino. It has a great view of Punda and of the bridge operating. Their food was excellent and their prices were very reasonable. The Aquarium was excellent, given the size of the island. If you are considering the Dolphin Academy, you would need to make reservations for this event at least 3 or 4 days in advance.

1086,NataschaM_12,665715,Camping L Hippocampe Argeles sur Mer Pyrenees Orientales Occitanie,Holiday of Horrors What we had been looking forward to for months turned into a horrible holiday with absolutely no assistance / interest from management. On the day of check-in we were allocated a mobile home (no. 3) facing onto the car park and rubbish bins just around the corner from reception. We mentioned to reception that this was not very safe for our 5 year old daughter as the garden was not enclosed. We asked to be moved to another mobile home and were informed that there was only one other available (no. 4) which was located around the corner next to the pool. Although quite loud we deemed this location safer and thought the noise would not be an issue as we would be out and about for most of the day. How wrong we were!! Little did we know that the evening entertainment in the restaurant located next to the pool would go on until 11pm and with some nights the music / base so loud that the floor of our mobile home would vibrate. To top it all off the public areas would start to be cleaned from 06:30 so even a lie in after a late night due to the noise was not possible. We asked reception repeatedly to be moved but they said they were fully booked and although there were some mobile homes available they were not in the same ‘cycle’ as our booking which meant they could not be allocated to us. One of the receptionist even commented that there were no COMMENTS in our booking???

1087,PaulM255,665715,Camping L Hippocampe Argeles sur Mer Pyrenees Orientales Occitanie,"Super holiday We have just returned from a lovely holiday at Hippocampe It was the perfect location for all the family. It is a smaller park than its sister park La Sirene. It has the advantage of being fully pedestrianised and quieter. You have full use of all facilities at La Sirène so you have the best of both worlds. We would definitely recommend Hippocampe ahead of La Sirène for this reason. We stayed with Eurocamp in a 3 bed Espace. It was perfect for 4 adults and 2 kids. Special thanks to Ray and Wendy euocamp couriers. They made our holiday most special. They are truly amazing genuine people who cannot do enough for you, a credit to themselves and eurocamp. The pool is amazing for all ages. It comes highly recommended by an 11 and 7 year old who preferred it to La Sirène. There is a kids playground and plenty of sports facilities. We ate snacks and had a few drinks at Bambou, we can recommend the chips, drink and the staff. Thanks to Marta from Torino. Bring a beach mat to lie out at the pool as there are no loungers which we thought was grand. If you would like a seat, a high stool at Bambou provides a great view of the pool. No shoes allowed in pool area so mind your step. No need to bring loads of stuff with you as the supermarket at La Sirène is well stocked with all you could need and the bakery next door is full of delicious bread (boule froment recommended) and treats for all. There is a doctor on site (10am and 6pm) next to the supermarket in La Sirène in case of illness or mishaps, Thanks to Sandrine and all the reception staff who looked after everybody so well.

1107,IrishBride2Be,665715,Camping L Hippocampe Argeles sur Mer Pyrenees Orientales Occitanie,"Lovely campsite - can't wait to return. We stayed here in June 2016 for 1 week with 2 young kids aged 2&4. We all loved every minute of it, the campsite was relatively quiet when we were there and it’s not too big so you are never too far away from the pool area. The pool area was lovely, heated pools which was perfect for the younger kids, fully supervised, nice shaded areas and was not too busy at any time. There is a nice, small playground just down from the pool area and an astro turf pitch. The mobile home we had was basic but it was comfortable, clean and had everything you needed. The bigger campsite La Sirene is just across the road, which you can use all amenities of. We had a look at the pool area here, very impressive but we kept to the smaller one in L’Hippocampe for our kids. Older kids would love the pool area at La Sirene. The shop at La Sirene is well stocked with fresh bakery every day, a little overpriced but you’d expect that. We had rented a car so we did a big shop at bigger supermarket close by (5 mins drive). La Sirene posted the listing of daily activities, kids clubs etc – lots to do every day. The only thing we went to was a half hour kiddies disco but it was at the very far end of La Sirene campsite and was a bit of a trek for us. There was bike hire, mini golf, archery and a good big playground for all ages in this area. There was entertainment on every night in La Sirene and a few nights at L’Hippocampe. (only seen a few minutes of musical Grease on stage and it was brilliant). We could hear it all from our mobile home but it finished at 11.30pm so it didn’t disturb your sleep too much. There is a nice train ride into the town that stops outside the campsite a few times a day. 10 mins in and 40 mins home. Kids loved it and it wasn’t expensive. We only visited the seaside and port area of the town and its very nice, lovely long promenade stretching the length of the beach. Very clean area with good selection of restaurants to choose from. We flew into Girona Airport in Barcelona from Knock Airport in Ireland and hired a car with ‘Economy’. I had read a lot about the trouble people had with car hire driving from Spain to France but we had no issues at all, very good company to deal with, very straight up and no hidden charges!! L’Hippocampe is only 1.15 hrs north of Girona, straight road, cost about 10euros in tolls though! There is a beautiful little seaside town 15 mins away from campsite called ‘Collioure’, we visited there a couple of times and it was gorgeous. Lovely beach areas and restaurants/bars overlooking the sea. The only downside to the campsite was the selection of restaurants – there is only one restaurant between the 2 campsites (in La Sirene), the food was expensive and was not great. There were bbq’s at all mobile homes so we had bbq’s most nights. This was our first campsite experience but we had a ball for the week and I would definitely return to this campsite again, I have recommended it to friends of mine as well.

1111,MadameAdam,665715,Camping L Hippocampe Argeles sur Mer Pyrenees Orientales Occitanie,"Great 1st camping experience, Kids had a ball. Let it be known, I am not a camper. I like the idea of it, but I like my comforts too much. This for me was a good compromise. We were in need of a family holiday, somewhere not too expensive and somewhere that the kids would be happy, but so would we. We live in France, so driving was an easy option - just 5 hours from Bordeaux - and we loved the idea of going somewhere near the Spanish border with all the Catalan food influences. We chose L'Hippocampe because it seemed a bit more small and intimate, with enough going on, but not so much that you feel like you're in a theme park nightmare. On arrival we were met by a very happy and friendly man named Bernie. He sent us to reception in order to don our bracelets (these help the staff determine whether or not you should be on camp, and if kids don't have one they therefore must be accompanied by an adult or no pool for them). Bernie then led us to our lovely 2 bed 2 bath cabin. It was very clean, simple and roomy. We had a small wooden deck area with small gas BBQ, table, chairs etc and we could park our car right outside. The only downside was what we first thought of as a beautiful pine tree soon splattered our decking with lots of bird xoxox.... Aside from that, we loved our space and our neighbours. Our kids (9 and 4) soon made friends, and all went off to the playground pretty much all day every day. We were lucky enough to have good kids and parents around us who always made sure each were looking out for the other. The pool was clean and beautiful, with slides and fountains and waterfalls. There was a security guard with a watchful eye and wasn't scared to tell the kids when they were maybe being a bit dangerous on the slides. The settings were lovely and we really felt we could relax a bit in a safe environment. Over the road we were able to use the facilities in Sirene. Here there were huge slides, about 5 pools and a beach bar. We loved it, but just to visit and then return to our smaller more peaceful plot across the road. I reckon in the main season it wouldn't be as much fun as there were just about a manageable amount of people in May. Our 9 year old got to do his first scuba dive in the Sirene Dive shop, and Mark the instructor was absolutely brilliant. I dive, and I thought he managed 2 9 year old boys brilliantly. It was fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone as an experience for their adventurous children. I could go on and on about it, but basically, it was a brilliant week. The staff were friendly and helpful, the area is fantastic so worth taking a couple of days to go out and about further afield, and I would highly recommend it.

Family of 6 - two adults and 4 children aged 12,10,8,and 5. We had a 3 bed mobile with Lifestyle holidays which was very modern and clean. Our pitch was near the pool & in a shady location which suited us. At night-time some noise can be heard from an adjacent road and from the entertainment at La Sirene. This did not bother us, however if you are a light sleeper you would need to request a pitch at the back of the site. Mike, Sinead and Lou, the lifestyle reps were extremely helpful and we could not praise them too highly. We travelled by a pre booked taxi (www.taxiestartit.com) from Gerona airport in approx 1 hour. For us this was more economical and a lot less stressful than hiring a car.

The pool at L'Hippocampe is heated, it is small but with adequate variety for all ages in our group. The poolside bar also showed live GAA matches which for us was a big plus. The entertainment at night at La Sirene is superb - live shows including Mama Mia, The Lion King and many more. We hired bikes to get around and found bike hire at Guidon Fute in Argeles (www.guidon-fute.com/) much cheaper than the bike hire at La Sirene. There are lots of daytime activities for children-football, climbing walls, mini golf, etc. The kiddy club run by the campsite is in French so our children were not willing to participate. The lovely promenade in Argeles is about 2km away and perfect for an evening stroll. The port at the end of the promenade has some lovely restaurants and the nearby scenic town of Coulier is well worth a visit. The main drawbacks are the absence of wi-fi at L'hippocampe. Wi-fi is available at the bar in La Sirene but it is totally unreliable. Also for a 5 star campsite there are no sunbeds at the pools in either site.

We stayed at Hippocampe with Keycamp for the first week of July in a 3 bed/2 bathroom caravan and this was our first holiday of this sort so didn't really know what to expect. 2 adults 3 children (7,3 and 1 baby). The Keycamp courrier met us on arrival and was very helpful on giving us orientation etc. The caravan was clean and tidy and relatively comfortable but very basic and the vans are extremely close to one another we could almost hear next door breathe! The evening entertainment is loud as others have written but to be honest we had sort of expected it and unless you are right on the outside wall (nearest La Sirene) then it wouldn't affect you too much, indeed on the nights we didn't go out managed to get the kids to sleep fine. The pool is fine, a couple of slides for younger children, our 3 year old managed and a couple for older ones. Pool ranges from .8 m in the smaller area to 1.6 m deep in the larger area. If you want a larger pool head over the road to La Sirene and use the one there. We found the Hippocampe pool to be sufficient for us. There is also a small park for the kids to play in which is sufficient and shaded from the sun. Small shop and bakery you can use over at La Sirene if you need anything but there is an Intermarche and Aldi about 2 km away for anything you need. One thing that could be improved is giving some wifi around the park for people as this is really lacking. We also expected, maybe wrongly, that there would be a TV in the caravan as it would have been good to at least catch up with some news while there.

The evening entertainment is loud as others have written but to be honest we had sort of expected it and unless you are right on the outside wall (nearest La Sirene) then it wouldn't affect you too much, indeed on the nights we didn't go out managed to get the kids to sleep fine. The pool is fine, a couple of slides for younger children, our 3 year old managed and a couple for older ones. Pool ranges from .8 m in the smaller area to 1.6 m deep in the larger area. If you want a larger pool head over the road to La Sirene and use the one there. We found the Hippocampe pool to be sufficient for us. There is also a small park for the kids to play in which is sufficient and shaded from the sun. Small shop and bakery you can use over at La Sirene if you need anything but there is an Intermarche and Aldi about 2 km away for anything you need. One thing that could be improved is giving some wifi around the park for people as this is really lacking. We also expected, maybe wrongly, that there would be a TV in the caravan as it would have been good to at least catch up with some news while there. For these 2 reasons can't give 5 stars bit overall a good and enjoyable holiday and we'd recommend Hippocampe to others",5,4,3,3,4,3,,,0.146593915,positive,4,1,1

1119,PaulqLiverpool,665715,Camping L Hippocampe Argeles sur Mer Pyrenees Orientales Occitanie,"Ok but won't be going back. So we have a four year old son and a one year old little girl. A couple of years ago we went to a place named Club Farret in Vias Plage, which was another of the popular French campsites. That one was excellent in that it was right next to the sea, had an outstanding recently constructed pool complex and the evening entertainment kicked off at about 7 ish. My review of that place was titled Perfect For Toddlers. And it was, just ideal in fact. We booked l'hippocampe as to be honest, it was the only one with availability in the region at late notice. It was ok. The Keycamp rep Glen was great and was there in a flash with some lightbulbs and new pillows when I called him. The mobile itself was clean and fine, although as with all these places you get what you're given, ours was under lots of trees and was a bit gloomy. Again, here I'd say they were too close together which meant on one several nights the Irish family next to ours kept us up until gone 2am. Also ours had no decking and only gravel outside which was rubbish for our daughter who had no space to crawl around on. But you make do, and we put down a blanket....The pools were ok I guess. Our son loved the slides. Big problem was lack of sunbeds or should I say absence of. Towel on concrete job then, which again, pretty rubbish. Food wise, over the road at the big sister site, and only fast food which was mediocre at best. There is a little pizza place out to the left, but again not memorable. It's biggest flaws are the location, which necessitates a car to get to the beach. Which we had, although the day we went it was like a hurricane. Back to the pool then. But the other problem which was a biggie for us was the evening entertainment. Spot on as per the other reviews, it is LOUD. But sadly, starting at 930pm is just too late for our kids anyway. The whole place therefore, wasn't for us. So, we spoke to Glen the rep, who called Keycamp and arranged for us to have the last two nights at Les Sablons up the coast.

The mobile itself was new and clean. We stayed with Kel Air. The site itself was really nice with mature trees and shrubs and although most of the entertainment is accross the street in La Sirene there is a pool and bar on the Hippocampe Site. We chose this site as a couple travelling without children because it stated in the brochure that this was the quiter of the two sites and thats what we were looking for. However when the entertainment started in the evening there is not just a little noise as described it is very noisy and it goes on some nights until midnight. That said and done if you have children it was probably great as on the Thursday evening there was a full scale porduction of Mama Mia. The beach at Argeles is quite nice although it is a fair walk to the beach from the camp. A couple of Kilometres away is a really nice supermarket for provisions and at the La Sirene site there is a well stocked concenience store. We travelled down to Spain from here as Argeles is not far from the French Spanish Border and at the sea front and harbour at Argeles there is lots of imformation about the history of the location.

I work for TOP SUN and although I've visited many of our other locations I finally made the trip down to Hippocampe with my husband and 4 yr old son - we stayed there for the last fortnight in June 2008- we did the trip by air/train/public transport, just to test out what works. We stayed very close to the entrance to hippocampe - from our bedroom window there was a gap in the greenery where we could see the laundry facilities/shower block. Indeed, we did get the full experience of evening entertainment from Sirene - but if it says it will stop at midnight, it does! It can also we more noisy when there is entertainment on at the Hippocampe bar, but the flip side to the evening noise was that by day you could be so busy, you'd sleep through anything! We didn't go over to the shows as our little boy was too tired by that point, but hearing it did make you feel a part of it! The pool at Hippo was excellent for a 4 yr old - although he found the slide very fast.

1125,london_loving,665715,Camping L Hippocampe Argeles sur Mer Pyrenees Orientales Occitanie,"L'Hippocampe, La Sirene Just returned so thought give a fact-based review to help others (stuff I wanted to know). We were 3 families - boys and girls of 7, 10 and 13. Booked with Siblu as couldn't book direct with campsite as full. Most owners' caravans looked OK so option to book direct. Caravans at l'hippocampe are extremely close to each other, closest of the sites I've been to. Flew from Stansted to Perpignan with Ryanair - beware, we booked in January for August and the flights were very expensive as Ryanair are the only carrier from London to Perpignan. Perpignan airport suddenly shut (happens very often apparently) so diverted to Girona, Barcelona. Coach took 2 hrs back to Perpignan. Taxi from Perpignan was Euro70 and took 25 mins. Try to book taxi that l'hippocampe use (alhuzzar or something was the company ) as the 8 seater minibus was only Euro55 which 2 families could share. L'hippocampe is small site (which was nice) with adequate swimming pool for younger kids, small bar with nightly entertainment (low scale, magician, jazz singer, etc), nice play area for kids. La Sirene is opposite (across quite a busy B road so younger kids couldn't go on their own). Good bakery, smallish but OK supermarket, newsagents, restaurant. Bigger pool plus pub and nightclub so lots of older teenagers. Nightly entertainment of a show (good quality, but in french with english songs!) which you can hear from l'hippocampe. People got tables 1hr before show started, so extremely packed. Restaurant with view of show was good, but you need to book a couple of days in advance. Good playarea for kids plus bike hire (Euro 13 per day, better rates for week). Walk to north beach is @ 15 mins along road (there is a bit of a cut-through at the 1st roundabout). The central beach area with shops and market is about 40 min walk along road, or along beach. Village is @ 40 minute walk inland but all along main roads. There is a good road-train system from outside L'Hippocampe which takes you to town, village, port, beaches. Return is Euro 4. Beach is divided into north beach (windsurfing, pedalo), central beach (main area), port (restaurants) and furthest is racou beach. Boat trips from port available - Collioure was lovely and worth going (20 mins by boat). I liked Racou, more laidback feel, less touristy and the campsite Bois de valmarie is here (smaller site, good restaurant, good smallish 3 pools with slides, but no evening entertainment). Houses directly on beach were available to rent. Racou to L'Sirene by roadtrain is good 40 minute ride (sometimes 55 mins). We hired bikes a few days to get around, bike route along beach but along roads to village (scary for children). Caucassone took 2 hrs by direct train and 2 hrs to drive (due to traffic in Argeles which is quite heavy). Barcelona was 4 hrs by train (we didn't bother), but apparently only a couple of hrs to drive. Luna park fairground is 10 min walk along roads opens at 9pm. OK for a couple of hours, fairly small and rides are @ Euro 3 or Euro 4 (La Sirene does a reduction card which works out much cheaper), also go-karting, bowling and adventure park available at same site. Aqualand, free bus from Luna park roundabout, was OK as well - again smaller sized but we spent 5 hrs there. L'Sirene has discount vouchers otherwise it's Euro 23 for adults and Euro 19 for kids. Big supermarket is 20 mins walk along main road (or part of way on roadtrain) (sites have gas barbeques with each caravan). La Kemia restaurant in Village was good. Opposite l'hippocampe is pizza restaurant which is OK (quite slow service though). Port restaurants were OK.",Hotel_Review-g196598-d665715-Reviews-Camping_L_Hippocampe-Argeles_sur_Mer_Pyrenees_Orientales_Occitanie.html,2007-08-01T00:00:00,"L'Hippocampe, La Sirene","Just returned so thought give a fact-based review to help others (stuff I wanted to know).

Flew from Stansted to Perpignan with Ryanair - beware, we booked in January for August and the flights were very expensive as Ryanair are the only carrier from London to Perpignan. Perpignan airport suddenly shut (happens very often apparently) so diverted to Girona, Barcelona. Coach took 2 hrs back to Perpignan. Taxi from Perpignan was Euro70 and took 25 mins. Try to book taxi that l'hippocampe use (alhuzzar or something was the company ) as the 8 seater minibus was only Euro55 which 2 families could share. L'hippocampe is small site (which was nice) with adequate swimming pool for younger kids, small bar with nightly entertainment (low scale, magician, jazz singer, etc), nice play area for kids. La Sirene is opposite (across quite a busy B road so younger kids couldn't go on their own). Good bakery, smallish but OK supermarket, newsagents, restaurant. Bigger pool plus pub and nightclub so lots of older teenagers. Nightly entertainment of a show (good quality, but in french with english songs!) which you can hear from l'hippocampe. People got tables 1hr before show started, so extremely packed. Restaurant with view of show was good, but you need to book a couple of days in advance. Good playarea for kids plus bike hire (Euro 13 per day, better rates for week). Walk to north beach is @ 15 mins along road (there is a bit of a cut-through at the 1st roundabout). The central beach area with shops and market is about 40 min walk along road, or along beach. Village is @ 40 minute walk inland but all along main roads. There is a good road-train system from outside L'Hippocampe which takes you to town, village, port, beaches. Return is Euro 4. Beach is divided into north beach (windsurfing, pedalo), central beach (main area), port (restaurants) and furthest is racou beach. Boat trips from port available - Collioure was lovely and worth going (20 mins by boat). I liked Racou, more laidback feel, less touristy and the campsite Bois de valmarie is here (smaller site, good restaurant, good smallish 3 pools with slides, but no evening entertainment). Houses directly on beach were available to rent. Racou to L'Sirene by roadtrain is good 40 minute ride (sometimes 55 mins). We hired bikes a few days to get around, bike route along beach but along roads to village (scary for children). Caucassone took 2 hrs by direct train and 2 hrs to drive (due to traffic in Argeles which is quite heavy). Barcelona was 4 hrs by train (we didn't bother), but apparently only a couple of hrs to drive. Luna park fairground is 10 min walk along roads opens at 9pm. OK for a couple of hours, fairly small and rides are @ Euro 3 or Euro 4 (La Sirene does a reduction card which works out much cheaper), also go-karting, bowling and adventure park available at same site. Aqualand, free bus from Luna park roundabout, was OK as well - again smaller sized but we spent 5 hrs there. L'Sirene has discount vouchers otherwise it's Euro 23 for adults and Euro 19 for kids. Big supermarket is 20 mins walk along main road (or part of way on roadtrain) (sites have gas barbeques with each caravan). La Kemia restaurant in Village was good. Opposite l'hippocampe is pizza restaurant which is OK (quite slow service though). Port restaurants were OK.",,,,,,,,,0.19122807,positive,3,0,1

Now in the brochure it says you may hear some noise but this was unbelievable. The stage was right behind us across the road. We had to use cotton wool in the kids ears just to get some sleep. As the week went by we were treated to Chicago, the Lion King (which we did go to watch but you had to be there 2 hrs before it started to get a seat and by the time it did start my husband had lost the will to live.)Blues brothers, Grease and The Bottles a Beatles Tribute band. Although credit to the group who perfomed they were very proffessional if you like musicals this is the site for you just like the West End! The other problem being was that they also had Karoke and magic shows at the bar on Hippocampe so some nights it was impossible to sit out with a glass of wine and a good book. Some nights they closed the bar in high season which we coudn't understand. We didnt let it ruin our holiday but i wouldnt go back to this site unless you like a really lively noisy holiday.

1128,jennycreche,665715,Camping L Hippocampe Argeles sur Mer Pyrenees Orientales Occitanie,"ten days in Languedoc The Boyle family,comprising of me,husband,two teenage children have just returned from a ten day break at a Siblu site-hippocampe in Argeles sur mer in languedoc.I thought I would give you a few helpful nuggets of info that you won't find on the Siblu site! Now we have camped almost every year since our eldest(now 20 and not joining us on this holiday)was a young lad so I kind of know what to expect on a camping break. In the main, the couriers are usually keen to help, but ill informed and occasionally certifiable-the Key Camp one in Brittany who wouldn't give me the cleaning deposit back because the mirrors were"" smeary ""springs to mind. The Siblu ones were true to form on this- ask them anything more challenging than the opening times for the shop and they looked at you with ill disguised panic as if you had asked them to do Calculus.However, my main gripe was that they just were not there when we arrived-hot ,exhausted, after a long, long overnight drive from Scotland to Manchester airport and an even longer check in.All we wanted to do was to get in the mobile home, unpack and go for a quick snooze.So to be told by the reception that we had a three hour to wait till we could do just that was a bit of a shock. In our experience,if you arrive before the official entry time, and I've always found it to be two rather than four pm as it is on Hippocampe, you can generally at least drop off your luggage at the caravan and quite often it's already been cleaned and you can get in.But not here. We were told to go for a swim instead. So we had to sit by the pool slowly frying- no sunscreen in our hand luggage due to check in restrictons,and frankly the thought of unpacking beside the pool to find our swim suits anyway wasn't a welcome one. Eventually, we got into our accomodation and it was very much as expected. We went for a three bedroom elegance model. The third bedroom is very small, and I was glad that we had only brought two of our kids. If more than one person had had to sleep in that room, they would have had to take it in turns to breathe to avoid using up all the oxygen. The Siblu courier was very keen to point out to us that the evening entertainment on La Sirene across the road was ""THe Lion King"" and advised us to hurry up and get a seat as it would get very busy.This was the only bit of info he gave us, but by then we were all dropping with heatstroke and exhausted and couldn't have cared less. I had chosen Hippocampe as you can use all the facilities on La Sirene as well and I thought it looked a bit quieter, being a much smaller site.However it was hard to tell as Siblu websites are strong on soft focus photos of small children gazing raptly at shells etc, and weak on actual facts....in actual fact we realised that we were only maybe two hundred yards from the main stage at La Sirene ,separated only by the road and a bit of fencing.We realised this at around ten pm when The Lion King really got going. Which is why I ended up lying wide awake in bed at twelve o'clock humming along to the songs.You may be interested to know that ""wim a way""is the same in French as English. I wasn't though.

The site itself is fine with a pleasant pool though that was very crowded.

No info from Siblu couriers on that!! We ended up taking the little yellow train into the centre plage most nights to get away from the noise from Sirene, and it was lovely . Argeles sur mer is a pretty village, and our teens liked the busy atmosphere, shops and restaurants. the road trains are the best way to get anywhere- but they aren't particularly cheap.You could walk to most places but it's not pleasant- all the roads are busy and some have almost no verge.

1134,k1gly,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"Hotel falkensteiner diadora - what we thought! The journey from Split to Petracane took around 3 and a half hours by coach. We were the last drop off, and the only 2 passengers staying at hotel Diadora. We arrived late and hungry. Having missed lunch we waited a further few hours for tea. We assumed we would be able to buy food at the bar, unfortunately the cooking staff were on a break, so we went without. The bar staff kindly provided us with some crisps in a bowl to see us through. The rooms are clean and tidy, the bathroom is large with a decent walk in shower, bath, toilet and sink. There is a TV, small fridge but unfortunately no kettle or Iron. You may be able to hire these but there’s no cups or ironing board. If you like an traditional English breakfast you’re going to be disappointed, like I was! We put bread through the toasting machine 6 times and still only got warm bread. The dial which controls the degree of toasting is broken. If you like toast then you’ve shot it. There are no baked beans at breakfast and only sausages of the continental type, they’re luke warm and look like hot dogs you’d cook in brine. No English bacon, only streaky mushed stuff. Having said that, if you don’t mind going without an English breakfast then there is plenty on offer. The food is presented well and the dining hall is clean and tidy. If your coming here as a family then the children’s entertainment will not be in English, the hotel consists mainly of other nationalities. The beach area is beautiful, it’s a gravel beach with amazing views and a clear sea. The beach offers free sun loungers to the guests. There is a mini market shop where you can buy tobacco and other stuff, a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Full board plus entitles you to free drinks in the dining hall. Everywhere else in the hotel you will have to pay, unfortunately all the fizzy drinks taste disgusting it’s a shame as you can buy coke from the bar, but it’s all at an extra cost! There doesn’t appear to be any burger bar or anywhere you can buy fries for children between meal times. The jet 2 staff don’t accompany you to this hotel, presumably because it is to far from Split. The hotel representatives do not visit either. The resort feels safe and secure. There are no restaurants nearby, if you want to eat out you will have to get a taxi to a nearby town like Zadar. We used Uber as it’s cheaper. We are unsure if the Uber drivers operate late at night so we’re reluctant to travel to Zadar in the evening incase we get stuck. Apparently the other taxis are expensive. Croatia looks beautiful, it’s our first time here. We hope to visit the Plitvice National Park in the coming days. If we were coming here again, we would pick an area with more amenities that was not so far from a town. The sea view is off to an angle, we overlook a road on the opposite side of the pool.

There are two chairs and a table no room for a sun lounger.",Hotel_Review-g1182225-d1380423-Reviews-Falkensteiner_Family_Hotel_Diadora-Petrcane_Zadar_County_Dalmatia.html,2018-08-01T00:00:00,Hotel falkensteiner diadora - what we thought!,"The journey from Split to Petracane took around 3 and a half hours by coach. We were the last drop off, and the only 2 passengers staying at hotel Diadora. We arrived late and hungry. Having missed lunch we waited a further few hours for tea. We assumed we would be able to buy food at the bar, unfortunately the cooking staff were on a break, so we went without. The bar staff kindly provided us with some crisps in a bowl to see us through. The rooms are clean and tidy, the bathroom is large with a decent walk in shower, bath, toilet and sink. There is a TV, small fridge but unfortunately no kettle or Iron. You may be able to hire these but there’s no cups or ironing board. If you like an traditional English breakfast you’re going to be disappointed, like I was! We put bread through the toasting machine 6 times and still only got warm bread. The dial which controls the degree of toasting is broken. If you like toast then you’ve shot it. There are no baked beans at breakfast and only sausages of the continental type, they’re luke warm and look like hot dogs you’d cook in brine. No English bacon, only streaky mushed stuff. Having said that, if you don’t mind going without an English breakfast then there is plenty on offer. The food is presented well and the dining hall is clean and tidy. If your coming here as a family then the children’s entertainment will not be in English, the hotel consists mainly of other nationalities. The beach area is beautiful, it’s a gravel beach with amazing views and a clear sea. The beach offers free sun loungers to the guests. There is a mini market shop where you can buy tobacco and other stuff, a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Full board plus entitles you to free drinks in the dining hall. Everywhere else in the hotel you will have to pay, unfortunately all the fizzy drinks taste disgusting it’s a shame as you can buy coke from the bar, but it’s all at an extra cost! There doesn’t appear to be any burger bar or anywhere you can buy fries for children between meal times. The jet 2 staff don’t accompany you to this hotel, presumably because it is to far from Split. The hotel representatives do not visit either. The resort feels safe and secure. There are no restaurants nearby, if you want to eat out you will have to get a taxi to a nearby town like Zadar. We used Uber as it’s cheaper. We are unsure if the Uber drivers operate late at night so we’re reluctant to travel to Zadar in the evening incase we get stuck.

1141,nostieandtinsley,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"Hard to find something to complain about..! The Falkensteiner Diadora exceeded our expectations. Travelling with our very active two year old son is never plain sailing but this hotel made everything seem possible in a relaxed environment. The staff were always present and friendly, yet remained refreshingly discreet and ‘left us to it’ unless we asked for assistance. This was really appreciated and added to the laid back and no worries vibe of the hotel. The food buffet is of an excellent standard. There is something for EVERYONE and everything is fresh and well seasoned. We didn’t have a bad meal during our entire fortnight there. Many clean high chairs and paper bibs available for use. Lots of drink choices from the self service machines including (not very good) wine and (average) beer. Many fresh and vibrant fruits available with every meal. This hotel caters for 98% Germans, which we loved as we felt like we were truly on holiday! The pools and beach are fantastic and well maintained and kept. There is a pool for ALL ages and all weathers. The bars serve well priced delicious coffees, cocktails and ice creams. We stayed in a superior sea view family room. Clean and modern with everything we needed. Nicest bathroom we’ve come across in a hotel for a long time. Very large bath and separate shower. Towels refreshed daily. Pool towels can be refreshed daily at the spa reception. Note, the ‘sea view’ rooms are slightly misleading. You have to be standing on a specific point of the small balcony to see the sea. We also found the noise from the animation team by the pool in the day times and early evenings to be disruptive to our toddlers sleep times. After one week we unfortunately had to change rooms as our fridge was leaking gas. The only room that reception could offer was a suite. No problem with us! This room was much larger and had a nicer balcony and most importantly to us, was so peaceful. I can see recommend one of these suites if you need extra space and have any little ones that are light sleepers. The entertainment staff are fantastic and although our son was too young to stay by himself in the kids club, they always made him feel welcome and included him in whichever activities he fancied participating in. Also Falky the dressed up character is my sons new super hero, that mascot is more loved by these kids than Justin Bieber, they wouldn’t leave him alone! The spa is BLISS, my husband and I had excellent massages and enjoyed the sauna, steam, plunge pool and relaxing in the orangery garden, albeit separately so that one of us stayed with our son. As soon as you enter the spa area you forget there is a child within a 10 mile radius! Highly recommended for some refreshing time out. We made the most of our time in this beautiful country by taking trips & visiting krka, plitvice, kornati, zadar & nin. These are all easily accessible and highly recommend to anybody wanting to experience the real Croatia. A few suggestions to change my opinion on this hotel from a 9 out of 10 to a 10: - drinking water fountains needed in all areas - clocks in communal areas - lunch times starting at 12pm & dinner 6pm - a booklet in room containing all hotels activities and services - or better still, an app for the phone with live updates - an option to purchase ‘drinks packages’ such as a soft drinks wrist band for kids and perhaps some kind of alcoholic option for parents. - snacks and drinks sold in the hotels gift shop (a lovely shop, but sells only souvenirs, toys, clothing) - the ‘sweet shop’ next to falkyland to be used for something more useful (we didn’t see one customer in there in 2 weeks) such as a milkshake and ice cream shop or simply a convenience store selling drinks, snacks and toiletries.

The hotel is 30 mins transfer from the zadar airport.. the airport was fab, small so our bags came as soon as we got to the terminal ( taxi cost €35 each way) Diodora is focused on the family market, it is set ion a peninsula in a complex with the iadera hotel and apartments, each residence has its own pool zone with an entry gate which make it difficult to use the sister hotel facilities. However there is a ""promenade"" to allow access to the beach and sea all the way around the edge of the complex. Diodora has a man made sand beach with inflatables in the bay, which were great to swim out to. My children loved the sea trampoline and inflatable slide . The beach life guard hands out life jackets free of charge so even less confident swimmers can make it to the inlatables. Lots of water sports form the beach club, which are payable locally; paragliding, banana boat, jet skis, paddle boards and peddlos all available. Further round the ticks coast the hotel has secluded platforms for sunbathing with ladders to safely access the sea. Outside iadera there is a pebble beach. Lots of loungers on the beach and by the pool so you could always get one without needing to reserve early with a towel. ( need to get there early for a hammock though) Pool scene good, the water slide was very sedate ( boys said slow!) so would suit little children, the heated pool has a indoor and outdoor section which was great for my smaller child who gets shivery in cold water, there is also a bigger unheard pool with a mini lazy river. Falky room was just big enough for us... the 10 year old said the bed was too small (quite narrow single bed) and the kids bedding was aimed at little children. Bathroom was lovely . The buffet restaurant was very well run and had a high quality array of food ...always a different fish and meat every night ...steak, salmon, langoustines, mussels, prawns, duck, monkfish, John Dory all made an appearance as well as different risotto, pasta pizza and salads every day.

Very little part of kids animation is done in English. So I could see older kids lost in competitions simply because they did not understand what they had to do and become sad because they lost to younger kids with understanding German. When my daughter asked to explain rules in English there was no answer. However most staff on reception speak English well. And they are really helpful when it needed. Food: The selection for breakfast was not for 4* hotel. But the lady that made eggs and omelette was so nice so we could not refuse eggs any day :) The lunch and dinner had selection of 5-6 items in main course menu and salads and cheese. Would not so bad, if was not so salty. My kid does not like salty food so it was really hard to find something that she could take. In between the main meals you have to pay for everything even for water, Rooms: We booked family room with a separate place to sleep for kids. Guess who slept there? I did. Because if both sliding doors are closed the room looks like a prison. Really scary. The rest is fine. Cleaners made a good job so we did not have any problem with room, towels or something else. Well done! The problem with room was in absence of noise insulation. Once your neighbors wake up, you'd wake up too. Facilities: 2 pools - one indoor with warm water. Was really helpful in rainy day. Slide made my daughter's stay more enjoyable. Sand beach is always full, but there was a lot of other places with less people but child should swim really well to enjoy them. The rest kid's facilities are for babies. 9-12 yaers children played on 4 desktops in playzone or watched how other played. Overall: Not bad, but very overpriced. If guests has a car, they need to pay for parking 10€ a day. I was charged for 10 days parking while had a car only for 3 days. Every call to service desk is not free. For such money half of services should be for free and minibar should be full of free drinks and snacks. Like in Spain :) PS: Be careful when booking this hotel on Booking.com.

1167,J_Sazzle,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"Wonderful holiday option for young families We are recently back from a 6 night all inclusive stay and had a great time. The hotel makes it very easy to travel with young children - plenty of buggies to borrow, good high chairs that were always clean when we got to them, though thanks to our 20 month year old son never afterwards! Cows milk freely available from the well-equipped and quiet baby corner behind the reception. The Falkyland kids area was very bright and welcoming with lots for children to do. We used the baby sitting service one of the days and the staff were really nice and our son was very happy with them. You have to book the day before so bear that in mind. The room was a very good size and the bed was very comfortable. We booked a room with a sea view and while you could see the sea it was at an oblique angle so this fell short of our expectations. We were square on to a road actually. However down that road a 2 min walk away was a well stocked little supermarket, which we used to get a few things. The all inclusive was good, the food was very well presented and there was lots of variety, varying along a few themes. E.g. each day there was a different meat, fish, pasta, risotto, soup, vegetarian options with consistent salad and bread to accompany. Also lots of dessert and fruit - the fresh figs were sublime! The kids buffet was ok, much more limited and actually our son mostly ate from the main buffet, where there was plenty to tempt him with. You get a red and white wine plus a larger to self-serve at lunch and dinner times. There was no option for any all inclusive spirit and mixers, which was a bit disappointing. I've been in all inclusive hotels before where you do get this at restricted times so I think this is something the hotel should consider offering. You can buy these at a couple bars though. There was incidental entertainment at dinner time which was fine and quite pleasant. Our son loved the Falky character that would frequently walk around in his suit and meet the children, this was a nice touch. There were plenty of inflatables to use in the pool and the hotel's near by private beach. We didn't need to buy them they were just left around for you to pick up at the bottom of stair wells. We went to the sea front paid fish restaurant on the last night and it was good and a very nice setting. If we had our time again we would probably have walked a little further around to the next restaurant which was a pizzeria and grill, it was just lost on us that there were actually two restaurants until we'd been! There is a cash machine outside the main entrance which dispenses kuna. They day we wanted to use it it was not working, which was a bit inconvenient and we had to postpone our para sailing because of it but the next day it was working again and we still got to go fortunately. I would encourage the hotel to make sure the cash machine is alway working, of course it is in their interest to do so.

After reading so many positive reviews we booked the 9 night (expencive!) stay without hesitation. Upon arrival everything seemed to be as we expected from a luxury family hotel. We were greeted by a friendly and accomodating lady at the reception and the room seemed spacious enough (family suite with sea side view room nr 2301). The diner was 'so-so' the first evening. The following days shared a pattern: Good breakfast, mediocre lunch and terrible dinner. As I'm a Croat myself I know what Croatian food is supposed to taste like, and this isn't it. Undercooked meals, dirty (dishwasher-style) plates,... this is not what you expect to see when the price is this high. Out of the 9 nights the airconditioning worked maybe 2 nights and during all but the first day the room was filled with ants.

1177,sarahrV4455DW,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"Great Stay!!! **Beware of Booking.com pricing** I just got back from our Croatia trip. We loved the resort! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Everyone spoke English. The ladies at the SPA were amazing. I booked 2 massages during my time there. The prices were very good as well. A full body massage 50 mins was around $54. The resort was very well kept and beautiful. I only had a couple of issues with the resort however. I feel like the quality of the food wasn't good. I understand that I visited during low season but the food seemed to be very bland. I watched one cook just throw chicken breast on the grill with no seasonings. Tons of seafood, which is good for someone that loves seafood. For us non-seafood eaters there wasn't a big variety of food to eat. You have to eat during the assigned times and you won't find any food after the restaurant closes. The first night we ate early around 6:00pm. Around 9:30pm my kids were a bit hungry and there was no where to get food or drinks. The bar stays open til midnight but anything you get from there is not included and you must pay for it. My family enjoys drinking Coke. The Coke offered during the buffet is not good and taste nothing like Coke. So we would get Coke from the bar which was actually Coke in a bottle. A round of 4 Cokes was $15 each time. The only alcohol that is free and included is a white wine, red wine and beer. But again you can only get it when the buffet restaurant is open. My kids liked the Arcade but it was 5 kun every game. The rooms was really nice and spacious enough. The air conditioning was turned off throughout the entire resort so at night we had to sleep with the balcony door open when it got really hot. The fridge in our room didn't really work either.TV was horrible. Out of maybe 30 channels there was only 2 in English. All the other channels were in German, Croatian, and Italian. None of the cartoon channels were in English. My daughter was a bit disappointed! Besides, those issues we had a great time. Definietly would recommend it to families with small children. Resort really caters to kids. My kids are 10 and 13. My 10yr old loved it. My 13yrs not so much because he was a lot older. Tips***** 1. If you want to go downtown Zadar the resort will call you a taxi. He charged 230 Kun which is around $34. They allow you to reserve a pick-up time with the same taxi or you can find one on your own. Right before you get to the bridge that connects Old town with New town there's a taxi stand with several taxis. Take one of those back to the resort. He only charged 160 Kun which was around $22 2. After we ate lunch and dinner, we took some food back to our room to have something to snack on until the opened back up again. If not like I mentioned earlier you can't get anything to eat until the next time they open. 3. If you book through Booking.com, even if you put 2 adults and 2 children in the search box the resort price is different than what Booking.com gives you. Apparently Booking.com price is per adult with no children. So when I booked through Booking.com my total hotel stay was 488 euro for what I thought was 2 adults 2 children. The next day I received an email from the hotel requesting the ages of my children. Children 13yrs and over are considered adults. So I ended up have to book 2 rooms because my 13yrs was considered an adult and only 2 adults per room is allowed. For my daughter I had to pay half price for the adult price. In the end after going back and forth with them I ended up getting 2 rooms and paying a total of 775 euros. We got side by side rooms with a connecting door inside. My kids loved getting their own room but I wasn't too happy. I contacted Booking.com with no reply but I really feel they need to clarify that before you book.",Hotel_Review-g1182225-d1380423-Reviews-Falkensteiner_Family_Hotel_Diadora-Petrcane_Zadar_County_Dalmatia.html,2017-04-01T00:00:00,Great Stay!!! **Beware of Booking.com pricing**,"I just got back from our Croatia trip.

A round of 4 Cokes was $15 each time. The only alcohol that is free and included is a white wine, red wine and beer. But again you can only get it when the buffet restaurant is open. My kids liked the Arcade but it was 5 kun every game. The rooms was really nice and spacious enough. The air conditioning was turned off throughout the entire resort so at night we had to sleep with the balcony door open when it got really hot. The fridge in our room didn't really work either.TV was horrible. Out of maybe 30 channels there was only 2 in English. All the other channels were in German, Croatian, and Italian. None of the cartoon channels were in English. My daughter was a bit disappointed! Besides, those issues we had a great time. Definietly would recommend it to families with small children. Resort really caters to kids. My kids are 10 and 13. My 10yr old loved it. My 13yrs not so much because he was a lot older. Tips***** 1. If you want to go downtown Zadar the resort will call you a taxi. He charged 230 Kun which is around $34. They allow you to reserve a pick-up time with the same taxi or you can find one on your own. Right before you get to the bridge that connects Old town with New town there's a taxi stand with several taxis. Take one of those back to the resort. He only charged 160 Kun which was around $22 2. After we ate lunch and dinner, we took some food back to our room to have something to snack on until the opened back up again. If not like I mentioned earlier you can't get anything to eat until the next time they open. 3. If you book through Booking.com, even if you put 2 adults and 2 children in the search box the resort price is different than what Booking.com gives you. Apparently Booking.com price is per adult with no children. So when I booked through Booking.com my total hotel stay was 488 euro for what I thought was 2 adults 2 children. The next day I received an email from the hotel requesting the ages of my children. Children 13yrs and over are considered adults. So I ended up have to book 2 rooms because my 13yrs was considered an adult and only 2 adults per room is allowed. For my daughter I had to pay half price for the adult price. In the end after going back and forth with them I ended up getting 2 rooms and paying a total of 775 euros. We got side by side rooms with a connecting door inside. My kids loved getting their own room but I wasn't too happy. I contacted Booking.com with no reply but I really feel they need to clarify that before you book.",5,,,5,,4,,,0.134567641,positive,4,1,1

We were also using the Diadora stroller since it was very clean and handy. Our two older girls had a great time in the play area.

1183,kongo09,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"Decent family hotel, but lacking on details The Diadora is a decent family hotel. Expect loads of kids running around with an associated noise level. Don't come here, if you don't bring / have / like kids. The hotel presents itself in a fresh and modern setup. On the surface, it is very kid-friendly. This starts with the little ramps at reception, so that even smaller kids can walk up to the receptionist and talk at eye-level. There are strollers to borrow, a special baby area behind reception for quiet feeding and 24/7 food preparation. The restaurant features high chairs and as you certainly have seen in the hotel description, there is a kids animation program and child care. However, if you look a bit closer, you can also find some not so impressive details which we would urge the management to fix asap, e.g. some mains sockets in the kids area with the games were coming out of the wall. That's extremely dangerous, And at least in one open staircase, a sofa was standing close enough to the railing so that a kid could climb over. That doesn't comfort. Rooms are well setup with a special sleeping space for two kids, closed off from the main room. That's a nice idea and gives the kids some privacy, What we didn't like so much was the bulky flatscreen TV dominating the central desk at the foot end of the parants bed. It effectively sits in the middle of the room and calls out to be looked at all the time. That's not kids friendly. Apart from that, the rooms had nothing missing, the bath was well setup with separate shower and bath tub. For the kids, there is a small pedestal to reach up to the basin. Good idea! Food is not something to praise, unfortunately. While the dining area itself is in a nice design for the large number of guests it needs to server, the food itself varies quite a bit in quality. We attended off-season with not many guests around and that seemed to be rather a problem for the kitchen, which tried to keep up the variety but somehow compromised on quality. Fruits and cucumbers were typically tasteless. Vegetables not too impressive either. The worst, however, are the drinks. No natural juices, no still water (apart from the machine water from the soft drinks machine, that always tasted like some sugary stuff was added). The juice machine produced really horrible stuff and the soft drinks machine seemed to do its local variation of coke, sprite, fanta and the like, which was rather disappointing. Improving drinks would be the single easiest thing to improve the overall hotel experience. Variety of food, however, was great. Over one week, we never had the same buffet offer twice. There is a bit of a show kitchen where fish and meat are done freshly in front of you (and actually are not too bad at all). In the evenings, there is an ice cream stand which enjoys some popularity by the kids. The kids have a separate eating area and also some so-called kids dishes (the usual french fries, chicken nuggets, etc...). The pool and spa area were well done and all very clean. There is a shallow kids water playground indoor separate from the real pools, so that not much can happen. The real pools (one of which is indoor and heated with a channel to swim out) are all 1.40m deep, so if your kid cannot swim, this is dangerous and you need to pay attention all the time. The indoor pool has an area of 90cm where our kid was able to stand, but under water there's a ramp going down to the deeper parts, so even here a lot of care is necessary. Kids can visit a swimming school, but we haven't tried that. The sauna features a steam and a finnish sauna in a nice spa space. Certainly in good standard and we enjoyed that a lot. You can also get a massage but don't expect anything fancy. Our son had his first kids massage and enjoyed that a lot. The whole complex is located on a private peninsula called Punta Skala with a private beach. However, don't expect much of a beach. It's a small patch of coarse sand on an otherwise rocky coast. Nothing to build sand castles. Staff at the hotel is extremely friendly and tries to be genuinely helpful. That's true for the restaurant, the reception, the room service, the child care, etc... We felt very welcome and all our questions and requests were dealt with swiftly. Two final points that we found negative: the kids area features quite a few game machines that all work on 5 Kuna coins. I don't find this appropriate and the playground should be free. Making some extra money with massages and stuff is expected and common, but earning extra on the kids is a bit inappropriate for a hotel like this and makes you wonder. Also annoying is the fact, that the peninsula is car free - and while there is a huge underground parking, it is charged extra a around 10 Euros a night. In the end we paid more for parking than for our rental car. Since there is no other practical way to get to the place, you could as well add the 10 Euros to the room price.",Hotel_Review-g1182225-d1380423-Reviews-Falkensteiner_Family_Hotel_Diadora-Petrcane_Zadar_County_Dalmatia.html,2016-10-01T00:00:00,"Decent family hotel, but lacking on details","The Diadora is a decent family hotel.

Normally we've only stayed at places that include breakfast, so after a long day of exploring it was nice to be able to 'come home' and know that dinner was taken care of. The food is very good with a lot of variety. There is even a small section of the restaurant dedicated to kids, but the selection is not nearly as varied as the rest of the restaurant. There is a huge selection of salad and toppings. It's easy to eat healthy here, but it's also easy to indulge! SLEEP: We liked that there is a separate room for kiddos...2 beds in a separate room with sliding doors. The beds were comfy, but not so sure about the pillows. Either way, I slept pretty good. However, the worst was the unruly children running up and down the halls until almost midnight. I cannot fault the hotel for this, but I do wish parents would respect that since this is a family hotel, some small children go to sleep around 9 and are easily woken. Bottom line, the only problem we had with sleeping was the unruly children running up and down the halls. Why do the parents allow this?!? KIDS: This resort is THE place for kids, but something that I DID NOT appreciate was that parents rarely watch their children. There is a very large kids area, which is divided into 2 areas.....a staffed child care area and a soft-play, rock climbing wall and game room area that is not staffed. There are signs that state that parents must remain with children. However, 90% of the time, kids are running around without any supervision. It's very upsetting because I witnessed some children hurting other children without any consequences. There are older children who are running around and rough-housing in areas meant for smaller children and it is easy for kids to get hurt. Some parents just don't care and other children have to pay the price. My son is 3 and we didn't utilize the staffed child care (because we are a FAMILY on a FAMILY vacation) but from what I could see the staff was very caring and attentive. They do a lot of varied activities with the children. Bottom line: there is A TON of stuff for kiddos to do, but a lot of parents abuse the child-friendliness of the hotel and let their children run around unsupervised and undisciplined, which I think takes away from the experience. LOCATION: Right on the water! This resort is NOT in downtown Zadar, which we really liked. It is actually in a gated resort area (there are 3 resorts in that one area). It felt very safe and secluded. You could go swimming either in one of the several pools or on the beach. You could take a long walk and collect shells and watch the sun set. There are no cars allowed to drive around the resort. There is a parking garage and then you walk around the resort (not a lot of walking). Overall, my husband, my son, and I really enjoyed our stay. The only thing(s) we didn't like were the unruly, unsupervised children that would run around all day and into the night. I mean, they were riding scooters and skateboards through the halls! The food, atmosphere, staff, location, etc. is wonderful, but the unruly, unsupervised children and lackadaisical parents really take away from the experience. I can't fault the hotel for this, because it's really the parents' job. Some parents just really don't care and it takes away from other families enjoying their vacation. It's just hard to enjoy a family vacation when you have unruly, unsupervised children hurting your child or disrupting your sleep.

Firstly, you need to realise that Diadora is part of a chain of German hotels and German speakers form a large proportion of their clientele. As such, there are certain services and facilities which are essentially unavailable to non German speakers (e.g kids club animations). The staff do speak English perfectly well and are just as welcoming to other nationalities, but it does cause some problems. Secondly, the wifi in the hotel is appalling. This wouldn't have been such an issue - after all, we were trying to enjoy ourselves as a family rather than update Facebook every 2 mins - were it not for the fact that we do not speak German. To explain: our room was perfectly nice and well designed for a family with a small separate bedroom big enough for kids. The room had a television as you might expect, but most of the channels were in German. There were only three English channels, all showing 24 hour news. The in-room movies did not work at all (all menus and instructions were in German) and we eventually worked out through the front desk that it had been broken for the last year. As such, once our daughter was in bed there wasn't anything for us to watch on the TV. We tried to stream a movie on our iPad but the signal was far too weak to allow this. The weak wifi also meant that we could not set up a baby monitor over the network so we could pop down to the bar for a drink. Once baby was in bed you therefore had no option other than to read a book or a magazine in your room. Not the best. We eventually found that there was occasionally an English movie on Croatian channels, but I would really have looked for a little more from a relatively new 4* hotel. Apart from these troubles, there is much to recommend this place. Several pools (indoor and outdoor) including one specifically designed for under fours. Adjoining pebble beaches. Very good buffet food. Friendly and helpful staff. Unfortunately, for us, the aforementioned issues mean that we would probably have preferred to have stayed elsewhere.",Hotel_Review-g1182225-d1380423-Reviews-Falkensteiner_Family_Hotel_Diadora-Petrcane_Zadar_County_Dalmatia.html,2015-09-01T00:00:00,"Solid, but better for German speakers","My wife, our two year old and I stayed at this beachside resort hotel near Zadar for three nights.

We arrived very late in the evening to our Family Room. All was clean but the kids beds had not been done and no bedcovers were provided for them. We were given them the next day. Early on during our visit we had booked a Full Body Massage at the hotels spa. This proved to be a complete shambles of a few hours. The sauna and showering area was good and clean, but the therapists need to be addressed by the hotel management. We opted to share a room, which proved to be a big mistake as for the first hour the therapists kept on talking and sniggering with each other. It started off quietly, but became louder. So much so that l had to ask to be moved to a private room, hoping l could enjoy the rest of the massage, but at this point it was too late. Came out of the massage more tense than when entering. I wrote this down in the questionnaire that was given to me after the massage and also mentioned this to my therapist and the spa reception staff, but heard nothing of it afterwards! An apology would not have gone a miss. On departure we mentioned this again, and our request of not paying for the treatments were respected. The food is good and varied, but the free wine is the usual vinegar. The alcoholic drinks purchased separately also seemed watered down. The restaurant got busier with the days we were there and can imagine it gets extremely busy and loud in high season. The evening entertainment for adults is ok. The music played by bands is very much evergreens. Although one here and there is nice, you end up feeling as old as your parents when ""Love is in the air"" type of music is played all evening long.

It is located in a gated community. Has its own private beach, with jet ski and mini boat hire. We will continue to return to this hotel every time we are in the Zadar region. We had our own car and found the place via satnav. The parking is convenient. The FOOD… oh boy! The FOOD. Its a massive restaurant, FULL BOARD. and there is anything your heart desires. I thoroughly enjoyed the watching the chefs make my nutella crepes fresh in the morning. There are over 5 food stations for chef's preparing food fresh to place on your plate, at breakfast-lunch and dinner!There is a children's restaurant located next to the main restaurant where the animation staff walk the kids in for their meals and out again back to enjoy their daily activities! The kids food is perfect for their age. And so many things are on offer. My fussy eater was satisfied at every meal! The outdoor pool area is the best! so many pools (all different) to choose from. There is also an outdoor pirate ship pool special for babies and toddlers- and next to that is a toddlers outdoor activity area. The poolside bar is great, you can order anything to be placed on your room account. The water slide is fun! The indoor pools are also great, the inside kids pool is fantastic… its always hard to get my kids out of that area. The wellness staff are very professionally and the facilities are good. The prices are reasonable for the quality and service. The staff overall are the best we have seen in any hotel. They all have a great attitude, a willing smile, they are fun and well mannered and the will make eye contact and say hello every time. The daily activities are used by more then had the hotel patrons, as they are fun and well catered for. The children have an outdoor mini disco before night falls, and then some get to go out to one of the night bars and dance around the live banD. This time it was and Aussie band, we were the only aussies in the resort so we we're happy to hear our own accent. i can never fault this hotel.

It was our first visit to Croatia and Falkensteiner Diadora is going to be our home for our future return visits to this wonderful country! A short introduction.. I used to work for a five star hotel chain, the Westin and thus know the hospitality industry inside and out... So when I say they are the best in service, I know what I'm talking about ( as my standards are usually very high). For the entire 15 days, we were staying put in the hotel premises for a good 10 days... Making use of their wonderful many pool facilities. My kids love love love the Falky Land's activities (children animation team) especially my 4 year old dancing almost every night to their childrens' disco. Even daddy had fun, looking forward to his daily 4pm beach volleyball! The care and attention shown to my family from the Animation Team, namely Damir, Aneta, Irena, Suzane & Marina was great! For example, when my daughter was badly swollen from all the mosquito bites ( she usually gets very bad reaction to the bites) .. Aneta and Susane arranged for Irena to buy some ointment from the pharmacy on her way to work cos there wasn't one near the hotel that's within walking distance and we didn't have a car. The restaurant team led by manager, Renato attended to our needs with efficiency that's truly 5 stars! Will like to include a special thanks to Christina , nicknamed, Kiki and Sascha for their friendliness and attentiveness towards us. Renato made us all feel very welcomed and was always present to make sure everything is well with us! Sorry for the long review but I can't help praising this hotel! The only reason I can think of why they aren't given that 1/2 star to make it official a 5 star is because of their lack of minibar items... But then again, who needs minibar when it's a full board hotel with such a great kitchen!! Buffet spread was fantastic! And most importantly when the kids are kept happy... So are the parents!

Aneta and Susane arranged for Irena to buy some ointment from the pharmacy on her way to work cos there wasn't one near the hotel that's within walking distance and we didn't have a car. The restaurant team led by manager, Renato attended to our needs with efficiency that's truly 5 stars! Will like to include a special thanks to Christina , nicknamed, Kiki and Sascha for their friendliness and attentiveness towards us. Renato made us all feel very welcomed and was always present to make sure everything is well with us! Sorry for the long review but I can't help praising this hotel! The only reason I can think of why they aren't given that 1/2 star to make it official a 5 star is because of their lack of minibar items... But then again, who needs minibar when it's a full board hotel with such a great kitchen!! Buffet spread was fantastic! And most importantly when the kids are kept happy... So are the parents! See you all again the next time we are in town! Serene & family ( the Singaporean and her Germans)",5,4,,,,4,,,0.262316071,positive,5,1,1

There is really little that I can say which is negative about this hotel. The personnel is very friendly, always helpful. The family suite which we booked for our family (43m) was modern with excellent sea views. It was a living room, double bedroom, small bedroom for children and 2 bathrooms. All rather small, but enough for all of us (Grandma, parents and 2 kids 6 and 1). the food was very good, always fresh and a very good choice. It was not gourmet, but good. The kids club also very good, only for kids 3 years and up. One swimming pool outside is heated, so perfect for our 6 year old. The inside pools are also heated and there are other non-heated outside pools for sports swimming as in September the water was too cold to just sit there and relax. But laps swimming perfect. the beach is a bit of a disappointment, it is dark/greyish sand imported from somewhere else. It is fine for children to play in, but has little scenic effect. The rocks further along the coast are looking better. There is little to do outside of the hotel. Nin is a little disappointing. Zadar is close (20 minutes by car), but nothing compared to cities like Dubrovnik. The walk to Petrcane is nice, ca 30 minutes along the coast, but nothing to do in Petrcane. The excursion to Krka is worth it, it is absolutely beautiful there. The weather end of September was excellent, always sunny, ca 24-26 degrees.

1229,im666_1999,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"Excellent family friendly resort - will return again We stayed at Falkensteiner Diadora for a week in middle of August for the first time. It was a fantastic stay for us and our 2 children. The resort is clearly geared towards families with young children – so anyone thinking they are going for a romantic vacation without screaming kids – beware! Resort is away from Zadar, so if you plan on going into town, either have a car or pay for taxi. Most of the families we saw here were German or Austrian and had their own cars. The rooms are setup excellently – with a sleeping alcove for children and the main sleeping area for the adults. The rooms can easily take 2 adults and 3 kids – with a child cot. The rooms are nice and spacious and well equipped – the hotel provides any child related item that you could possibly want – high chair, stroller (yes – strollers too!), bath tub, cot, etc. Bed is nice and pillows are fine – could use extra pillows though. The bathroom is nice and spacious and has a shower and bathtub – the shower doors (as in many hotels) are not very tightly shut so leak a plenty! There are lots of hidden closets and the storage space has been cleverly built into the walls and spaces. There are no tea/coffee making facilities – wifi is free, but very spotty in the rooms that are at the far end of the block away from main reception area. It was a blessing at times to not have wifi! Check-in was fine – there was no bell boy/captain to take our luggage – as this was our first time, came as a bit of a shock, but quickly learnt to use the trolley ourselves. Our first room was good, but we wanted a change and the reception gladly obliged and gave us another room within our category – hotel was booked, but they still tried which we appreciated. The dining area is well architected – its not the typical vast open space dining hall type feel when you go here. there are seating areas located around the buffet service, but these are in different colours and furnishings and make it feel discrete and distinct and separated too. The outdoor space is nice and overlooking the pools. They have a ton of high chairs ready and available for use – these are really CLEAN! The waiters and waitresses and ready willing and able to help if you need anything – which is really important if you have kids that are trying to learn to be independent and drop food. Food quality was good for the most part – a couple of nights, the fish was overcooked or salty – but feedback was taken well and acted upon and followed upon the next night. Range of cold and hot buffet items – all freshly made in the restaurant or brought from the kitchen. You could really tell that the food and meat/fish were fresh. Bread available in many varieties. Desserts too – some of the really popular desserts finished quickly – so get early if you see something you like. House wine and beer were decent – they do sell wine from the region and outside if you wanted to purchase separately. Now for the main reason this resort is excellent and so popular – kids are taken care of very well. The kids club is teeming with staff and activities throughout the day – at night, these’ discos and movies on big screens (youtube videos!) – only nitpick is that movies are in german the main audience, but for a small child a Disney movie is a Disney movie without the language needing to make any sense. The staff really do take care of the kids and genuinely care – the amount of energy they have is amazing. There is a soft play area for smaller kids and you are welcome to leave under 3s in the play room under your own supervision. Falky the mascot is the star and very popular amongst all kids The beach is man made and is actually quite nice – plenty of sand area and gently sloping into the water. Water is amazingly clear – walk over to the right side of the beach and there is a stone pier that you could literally jump off into the water. Lots of hammocks available – the chairs are usually reserved. Pools are nice and small and can be crowded and peak times – the indoor pool however is free most of the time! The kids pool is nice too – very very shallow and lots of games to play in. The onsite store that sells pool items is very reasonably priced – was pleasantly surprised to see no price gouging despite the captive audience. One big complaint is the lounge chair ‘reservation’ that happens each morning – we could see people coming to the pool area at 6 am and putting hats, books, towels to reserve their space – it is really annoying and management/pool staff should do something about this. There is a little room behind the reception which has water, milk etc and is available 24 hrs if you need a microwave or something. I could go on and on about how good this place is, but we have found a chain that is child friendly and will be looking to stay at their other properties in Austria soon.",Hotel_Review-g1182225-d1380423-Reviews-Falkensteiner_Family_Hotel_Diadora-Petrcane_Zadar_County_Dalmatia.html,2014-09-01T00:00:00,Excellent family friendly resort - will return again,"We stayed at Falkensteiner Diadora for a week in middle of August for the first time.

The girls still talk about Falky (the hotel's mascot), and play with their free stuffed animals. The meals are all included and offer a pretty decent buffet with a nice variety-- can't stay too long or you'll get enormous from all the food/beer/wine. One part that was not completely clear on the website was what the childcare costs are. If your kids are older than 3 or so, they can go to Falkyland and that is completely free of charge (though tips are welcome), but for younger kids (babies), there is a babysitting charge, and its based on availability of staff to accommodate it.

From the moment we woke up until about 9pm we found ourselves overwhelmed with choices for which activities we wanted to do next--- waterslide, warm pool, warmer pool, petting zoo? Sure. The girls still talk about Falky (the hotel's mascot), and play with their free stuffed animals. The meals are all included and offer a pretty decent buffet with a nice variety-- can't stay too long or you'll get enormous from all the food/beer/wine. One part that was not completely clear on the website was what the childcare costs are. If your kids are older than 3 or so, they can go to Falkyland and that is completely free of charge (though tips are welcome), but for younger kids (babies), there is a babysitting charge, and its based on availability of staff to accommodate it.

We have just arrived back and would thoroughly recommend this hotel. The staff were amazing. Starting at arrivals, we chose the family suites, these were for two parents, one 4 year old and one 6 year old, the second suite was for two grandparents, one 11 year old and one 13 year old. These suites were not for adults and teenagers sharing. We went to reception and managed to get two inter connecting rooms (the staff really went out of their way to help us), which worked out great, the parents with the 2 younger children stayed in the original family suite, all rooms immaculately clean and well maintained. The buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner was good, always a variety for both parents and children (some times it was enjoyed more than others by us). Great fun during the day for the younger children, lots and lots of activities to keep them occupied and again great pool activities for the teenagers, parent and kid mixed games, or adult pool volleyball. The animation team were all exceptional. If you didn't want to stay by one of the three pools in the hotel (plus an indoor kiddie pool), a short walk down to the private beach, on the way massive inflatable slide, trampolines, and paint ball targets, for extra amusement. Further along there is a water sport place and a great beach restaurant with two pools and access to another private beach with big floating climbing frames a short swim away. The hotel bar early evening always had music for the children and other fun acts etc, and of course a full life size walking and sort of talking 'Falky' the hotel mascot! After the youngsters went to bed there was some times music for the teenagers, sometimes a film by the huge slide (slide - was great fun). Then for us big ones in the evening, nice music and atmosphere in the outside or inside bars, always served by extremely polite staff who were all so helpful and friendly. On the negative side - the following very minor points. The wifi was extremely slow, understand that a lot of people are using this all at once, but they need to get a bigger server to cope with the demand. The juices and 'fizzy' drinks from the dispenser had no fizz and the juices were horrible, the beer was on some evenings extremely warm and the white wine was just about drinkable but in very small quantities. The sunbeds slightly uncomfortable, could do with cushions on them but this is more of a suggestion than complaint.

Amenities and activities for your precious ones are stunning. I would say optimal for kids age 3 to 7. The food is (mostly) phenomenal, offering a wide variety of options for adults and children. This is a self-sustainable resort leaving little need for having to take a trip outside the campus. Pools are just deep enough for adults, and shallow enough for kids to learn to swim. Water temperature varies from pool to pool, but is always very comfortable, even on the giant slide (which is not that slanted to be suitable to the youngest of kids). On the downside, I was truly disappointed with the level of service. Let me give you a few examples of their performance: 1. Used dishes are rarely removed from tables in the restaurant. Make sure you have enough room to store piles of plates 2. In all instances observed, I had to yield to the staff. E.g. when moving down the hallways, I had to step aside so that housekeeping could walk by me with trays. When taking food from buffet, I had to step away for a bit until a server took name tags (because lunch time just ended, duh). Every decent hotel 4 stars and up should know that guests go first. 3.

We booked a suite(43sqm with a sea view). The sea view can be seen from both sides, only we took the quieter side(meaning non pool side) and received an upgrade to this. Under Suite we do understood something rather differently, It is not really spacious, but it is functional and good for families with 2 kids. The service orientation was excellent throughout the stay. The food also excellent for a 4 star Hotel and all inclusive. Freshly made food all day long pretty much. Rather negative for an all inclusive is that the coffee from the machine is not so drikable and if you order water(bottled water) or a Cappucino, you pay extra. They immediately come with the bill even if you say that you will take another bottle. I guess its easier for them, but creates extra administration. The Falky Land was quite enjoyable and the kids places in the outdoor pool also. Our little one thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Garage to pay extra is also funny. If all inclusive, then include it in the price and then ok, no problem. However, Iva from the reservations was very nice and helpful. We booked a week, but after 4 days, decided to head to the more exclusive and peaceful Falkensteiner Iadera in the same complex some meters further. The animation program was good.

1278,SergeyV433,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"Seriously overrated. Stay away I can not understand all the rant on this site about this hotel. This would be a passable 3-star for somebody on the budget, but not more than that. Rooms are quite small and tight, There are no toiletries in the bathroom (Ok, there is a tube of cheapest squeeze-out soap next to the basin and a tube of universal bath gel/shampoo next to the shower - but these are not nearly suitable for a 4-star place). In general bathrooms are purely designed - the shower has poor drainage, and the doors have large transparent panels in them, so a person sitting on a toilet is quite visible, which is rather embarassing. Food is OK, but the buffet is extremely crowded, you can not get any tea or coffee during lunch or dinner, the only drinks included in their ""ultra all-inclusive"" is no-name fountain drinks. Swimming pools are also quite small, and sunbeds area is tiny for the the size of the hotel, so it's very crowded (and we are here in September, so imagine what it's like in August). Management does absolutely nothing about sunbeds hogging - putting a towel on one (or a dozen) in the morning and keeping it this way through the day, There is no proper pool for children - it's either a wading pool with 15 cm depth, or 140 cm - nothing in-between. The famed children club is also very small, in a very depressing windowless and poorely ventilated area and badly appointed. You also get a daily serving of ""entertainment"" right under your windows at 10pm, which is quite noisy. There is no beach either - very hard and sharp rocks only, so entering the sea is quite a challenge. The area around it is very empty, barren plain.

Facilities are all geared for family fun and are excellent. As to the seaside, if you want to play and walk on the sandy beach, and build sandcastles with your kids- go to Italy, the Croatian seaside is a different animal... it is rocky but the water is crystal clear. Even during hot dummer the gym and the spa was operational which we found very convenient.

1291,davidrusselllee,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"TERRIBLE!!!! The falkensteiner is a big family hotel with lots of stuff aimed at kids. My stay was paid for by work but it seemed incredibly expensive for what you got. We changed rooms because our first was noisy and right by the drive, they told us the new room was much more dearer (over twice the price) but it was identical apart from the floor it was situated on and the view, so remember that when booking. Food is typical mass produced buffet fare, made with kids in mind, cheap ingredients. Petrcane itself is a pleasant enough but unexceptional small fishing village and quite a long walk or taxi ride away and is little to do there - a couple of shops and a handful of local restaurants/cafe's - nothing even slightly exciting. so you would need to go to Zadar for any decent shopping or anything beyond the basics. Bearing all this in mind i was surprised the hotel was so busy, as frankly i would not enjoy a holiday here - with or without children. However my big problem with Frankensteiner was when we had something going missing from our room. We turned the room upside down and the item had definitely been removed - and i can categorically say 100% not by us. However the staff seemed to think it wasn't really their problem and even were joking about it - maybe they didn't realise my girlfriend also speaks Croatian. I was suitably annoyed and wrote to the hotel manager when I got home but all I was offered was money off a future booking, which was of no use what so ever. Not wanting to let the matter lie I then contacted the hotels head office in Austria hoping they would be more concerned about this sort of thing going in. I called several times and left messages and voice mails but despite promises of calls back they actually made no attempt what so ever to resolve the matter. Eventually I gave up as it was seemingly a waste of my time and money calling Austria. I'd expect this terrible customer service from Ryan air but not from a well established 5 star European hotel.

1298,ByeByeBlues7,1380423,Falkensteiner Family Hotel Diadora Petrcane Zadar County Dalmatia,"Boring contemporary/corporate style, but very well run. A really well run, 4 star hotel, in the middle of nowhere, outside Zadar. The decor is contemporary/corporate with the usual features and colours (Safe and effective, but boring if you ask me): - Minimalist, clean, long lines - Mezzanines overlooking the reception and downstairs areas - Architectural glass components - Brown, white, grey and beige colours - wooden panels and doors against concrete parts. The rooms (I slept in 2 over 4 nights in May/Low season) are in the same style as the rest of the hotel. The big windows allow lots of natural daylight to enter. The bathrooms are spacious and elegant with a funny (however stylish..) sliding glass door, diving the shower from the toilet. Some have a bath as well. The rest of the space in each room is pretty much essential. The beds are comfortable. I was quite impressed by the large garden area of the complex; it features several swimming pools, a restaurant, a bar and a children swimming pool/play area on different levels. The whole thing is well presented and operated. A little path at the front takes you to a stone beach with an excellent view and feel to it; it's ideal if you want to take a stroll to clear your head. I loved the many hammocks hanging from the pine trees (which gave lots of shade on hot days). The hotel has also a well organised SPA as well as an arcade game area.

We were unlucky with the weather, but otherwise the stay was a positive experience. The children in particular really enjoyed the hotel complex as it private/encolosed, not too large and enough to keep them occupied most days. On the plus side: 1) Resort was private, well maintained and very clean (including rooms). 2) Slide was excellent for young children and plenty of space & sunbeds around the pools. 3) Check-in was efficient, plenty of parking space and rooms (while small) were well laid out and well maintained. 4) Food very good, plenty to keep children satisfied. 5) Very good watersports at the beach...it was run by very friendly/helpful people...pretty good value also. They even adviced we didn't take the jetski's out one day with the young children due to strength of wind/waves (versus just taking the money as most do). 6) Nice spa/sauna area....relatively small but spotless and never too busy. Good place to ""chill out"" for 60 mins. 7) Short walk to the beach area....water clear/clean as you would expect, immediate sea area shallow and soft for the children. On the negative side: 1) If you have been to other all-inclusives in Croatia (especially the Valamar resorts), then Diadora appears ""cheap"" in it's approach to many things considering that the cost of a week is higher than the other all inclusive resorts (eg. beer and wine are not free with dinner, if you want to have a clean towel you must pay for each new one, parking costs 9 euro per day obligatory, etc). 2) Food quality is very good but the variety was a little repetitive. Didn't have any theme nights or ""fresh catch of the day"" type evenings that we have seen elsewhere. 3) Beach was a real disappointment. It's small (but that is clearly stated in the literature in fairness), but the part that is supposed to be sand isn't sand as I recognize sand. It was more black dirt mixed with the stones. Not really enjoyable to be on.

We stayed in a suite with a seperable childrens room which was perfect for us. Whoever designed the bedrooms really thought of everything, down to the lights on the floor in the childrens area, bedguards for small children, lots of storage space and best of all they are completely soundproof ensuring a great night's sleep everynight. The childrens entertainment programme is by far the best we have ever come across on holidays and the girls who run the programmes are exceptional. They really engage with the children and you will find it hard to prize your little ones away from the club. There is also a huge playground beseide the hotel.The pools are fantastic with lots of space and sunloungers for all guests. There is also a lovely (but small) beach right beside the hotel which is perfect for a dip in the Adriatic with lots of options for watersports. There is also a really nice beachbar when you need a drink to cool down. This hotel offers all inclusive, which I admit I was nervous about before we arrived, however you will not be disappointed.

1387,mcz6,289509,Hodelpa Centro Plaza Hotel Santiago de los Caballeros Santiago Province Dominican Repub,"Great service but hard on the ears If you're traveling to Santiago in the Dominican Republic you will find that despite this being the second largest city in the Dominican Republic and as opposed to the capital Santo Domingo, your range of 3 star and above lodging options are somewhat limited. This means that finding the right hotel, especially since the Hodelpa group has a monopoly of three in the area can sometimes be challenging , especially in high demand times. That being said, this hotel chain I found, prides itself in service which I certainly experienced at this one property. The Hodelpa central is a property that is in the heart of Santiago, just next to its major street. It is a six-story structure that by United States standards would be considered a three-star or at best a 3 1/2 star hotel. The 3 1/2 stars in my opinion are earned based on service. Indeed, the service was amazing, with attention to detail from the time the guest walks in the front door. This means that everyone from the bellman to the front desk personnel, the chambermaids and the breakfast crew was outstanding. I would like to highlight the breakfast experience as it was especially excellent. This hotel includes breakfast in its rates and they are not skimpy with it. This was a tough time for our family as we were there to bury my dad and there were a total of eight of us staying there and eating at the same time. The staff bent over backwards to make sure that our table was set up if it wasn't set up already and once we started eating (they were great with all the diners )they also made sure that the coffee cups were always full and that we had everything we needed. This included both the supervisor and his crew. There was even an omelette chef who also went out of his way to make sure that all of the guest needs were met. The buffet itself was very good with fresh fruit, fresh juices as well as Dominican and American breakfast items. Some rooms have balconies and others didn't. I had a room with a balcony facing the major street in Santiago. This means that it was quite noisy as the architects and builders failed to soundproof the room. The door was very porous and whether it was open or not did not make much of a difference. You must know that there's a lot of motorcycle traffic in the Dominican Republic and to compound the noise produced by these, the Dominican driver has a bad habit of honking horns at all times when there's not necessarily a need to. This means that during busy times that is from Monday to Saturday there was constant noise from roughly 6:30 AM until late evening. This made sleep very difficult early in the morning or during the day if a nap was needed. The other two rooms occupied by our party were somewhat better as there was more distance between this street and the room itself however the noise was still very audible. My sister in fact had to sleep with ""white noise"" to make it work. In conclusion this is a good hotel with excellent service and breakfast. The only drawback was the noise but if you're a deep sleeper who's not bothered by noise this is probably the best deal in Santiago. You will find cheaper hotels as I did look at a few but the rooms are either much smaller or older and there tends to be less service. In some others there are no elevators. In as far as their other two properties the Garden Hotel by the airport and the Gran Almirante, they are fine hotels as well but are more expensive (and less noisy) then the hotel I just reviewed.",Hotel_Review-g635962-d289509-Reviews-Hodelpa_Centro_Plaza_Hotel-Santiago_de_los_Caballeros_Santiago_Province_Dominican_Repub.html,2016-07-01T00:00:00,Great service but hard on the ears,"If you're traveling to Santiago in the Dominican Republic you will find that despite this being the second largest city in the Dominican Republic and as opposed to the capital Santo Domingo, your range of 3 star and above lodging options are somewhat limited.

That was nice from the saff, but I found the same issues concerning the room not being clean enough. The deluxe room does not differ much from the regular ones. It is a bit bigger, but furniture is nearly the same, and has a nice view of town. It is also on the same floor as the restaurant. I would give the restaurant 2 to 3 stars. Food is not consistent with what the menu describes, and seems to have been designed by a chef that left somebody else to do his job. For example, I ordered pasta with portobello mushrooms and they brought it with a different sauce and canned champignons. I also tried the typical Dominican Sancocho, and it was terribly bad. I can't figure how a Dominican kitchen can produce such a bad Sancocho. Rooms at the 4th and 5th floor are noisy. The ones with a view to the street get a lot of traffic noise, and the ones at the back of the hotel have a persistent noise from a generator.

1434,Chiki2399,289509,Hodelpa Centro Plaza Hotel Santiago de los Caballeros Santiago Province Dominican Repub,"I did not use the casino but the restaurant was a big plus since I was traveling on business by myself This hotel was recommended to me by a person who worked in the north area of Dominican Republic. The hotel is centrally located and three blocks away to the right of the calle del Sol you can find the Virgen de Altagracia church and to the left you will find lots of small shops, a supermarket and cafes. The hotel has a casino and a restaurant and a very convenient shuttle to and from the airport with wi-fi. I did not use the casino but the restaurant was a big plus since I was traveling on business. The restaurant is located on the 6th floor and even tough has a limited selection of local and fusion cuisine, I was pleased with their service and taste, especially when I ordered the Chivo liniero with fried plantains, it was delicious! Check in was fast, courteous and I received a card for a free drink. The room was clean and spacious but a bit outdated. The bathroom was clean and stocked with basic toiletries. As I mentioned, I used the room service during my stay and it was prompt and delicious. However, the prices do not disclose the surcharge for the service; at least I did not find it in the menu. The drinks in the room that are for sale do not disclose any charge or tax either. I drank two cokes listed for 85 DR Pesos and I paid 217 DR Pesos. Everybody was extremely friendly, when they saw me by the elevator or the lobby, they were sure to ask me if I needed anything. I do have to mention that the front desk was not able to exchange $20.00 for me, I asked for a $10.00 in pesos and $10 in dollars and one person sent me to the casino, only to find out that the casino did not carry dollars? All I needed was money for tips. Breakfast was included and I was happy to have fresh fruit and fresh coffee every morning. Wi-Fi in the rooms was very-very slow –somebody mentioned slow was the standard in the DR-. If you need to work online go to the lobby or to the business center next to the restaurant.

1455,Easylivingtravel,289509,Hodelpa Centro Plaza Hotel Santiago de los Caballeros Santiago Province Dominican Repub,"GREAT BUSINESS HOTEL WITH IDEAL LOCATION This is a perfect business hotel with restaurant on site. It is located close the shopping streets of downtown Santiago and two blocks from the Historic site Fortaleza de San Luis. The Monument is within walking distance( 10 blocks) also, however for just $3 it would be easy to take a taxi almost anywhere. I even was able to get a taxi to the Coast (Sosua) for $70. The room comes with a reasonably priced mini bar. The Vista Restaurant on site had great ethnic food and served good drinks. The pasta dish( spaghetti carbonara) that I ordered was not prepared very well, so I recommend ordering only ethnic Dominican food at the restaurant. Breakfast was also included in the price of the room daily. WiFi was high speed without interruption and if you didn't bring your own PC, there is a business center available for internet use. I felt very comfortable and safe at this hotel and would stay here again. Two banks ( Popular and Scotia) are adjacent to the hotel.

The hotel was nicely located for our students as they could walk easily to a market to buy souvenirs as well as a grocery store.

1467,plcitv,289509,Hodelpa Centro Plaza Hotel Santiago de los Caballeros Santiago Province Dominican Repub,"Acceptable; not many better options in the area I stayed here for 4 nights in January 2014. The first night, I woke up to take a shower around 5:30am and there wasn't any hot water. I talked to the front desk and they sent someone to the room. He either told me I need to let the water run for 5 minutes or run the water, wait 5 minutes, and then turn it on again. I don't know if the water heater is a long way from the room or it is an on-demand heater and just takes a while to heat up. On the second morning, I let the hot water run for about 10 minutes. Turned it off for a few minutes, then let it run for another 5 minutes and it started getting hot. Problem solved. As the other reviewers have said, Santiago is a very noisy city. The taxis are constantly honking and when a heavy truck or car with a loud radio drives by, it sets off the car alarms which go off for 15 or 20 minutes at a time. The only way to reduce the sound would be to replace all the doors and windows on the exterior of the building. That's not going to happen. My room was clean and the mattress was very clean. It is a basic room. A few minor complaints - the deadbolt on the door was broken and the lock on the safe had been drilled out. I was on the 3rd floor facing the Hotel de Sol. Yes, it was noisy, but not as back as Panama City. The floor of the room was tile - which I much prefer to carpet in hotels. The service in the restaurant as well as at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included with my room rate and the buffet was good. A good selection of fruit and breads and they will make you an omelete. I spent about 30 minutes in the casino in the lobby and had a good experience as well.

The welcome drink choice of pina colada or rum punch was a nice touch. The morning breakfast on the 6th floor was really delightful, with the view of the mountains, the excellent omelettes made to order, and a nice variety of fruits, baked goods and other options. Plan on noise from the surrounding city streets. They seem to like their horns in this town, but it didn't detract from the stay. I'd also like to mention that the booking staff was excellent. We communicated via email, in English, and their professionalism and good communication skills helped me greatly. As the arranger of the trip, their commitment that ""the hotel transport will be waiting for you"" was comforting, and they certainly delivered.",5,3,5,5,4,4,,,0.52289916,positive,5,1,1

1503,NY_Oak,289509,Hodelpa Centro Plaza Hotel Santiago de los Caballeros Santiago Province Dominican Repub,"Good hotel Stayed 2 nights in May 2009. This hotel is located not far from the monument. You enter this hotel on Calle Mella, near the corner of Calle de Sol. Calle de Sol is a busy street with restaurants and shops. Location of this hotel is good. Clean hotel, friendly staff. I had a room on the top floor (maybe 6th floor). There is a small gym and the Vista restaurant on that floor. My room was non-smoking, most of the hotel appeared to be non smoking. I believe most casinos, restaurants and bars are now non smoking in Santiago, as well as in Santo Domingo. The room I had, there were many windows, about half the room had windows. Small room, clean. Wifi reception throughout the hotel. Breakfast buffet was included, which was in the Vista restaurant. I was told that as a guest of the Hodelpa Centro Plaza that I could use the swimming pool at the Hodelpa El Gran Almirante, which I did on most days. From Hodepla Centro Plaza to El Gran Almirante Hotel was about a ten minute car ride. Very friendly and helpful people in Santiago, I got lost numerous times driving and many people were more than willing to help me. I ate at the Fridays Restaurant adjacent to the El Gran Almirante Hotel, very nice waitress, very clean restaurant. There is a small box on each table, whereby you can press a button and the waitress receives a signal on her wristband that signals her to come over to your table. I also ate at Kuka Maraca restaurant which sits facing the monument. Smoking is allowed in this restaurant on the second floor.

This hotel is located not far from the monument. You enter this hotel on Calle Mella, near the corner of Calle de Sol. Calle de Sol is a busy street with restaurants and shops. Location of this hotel is good. Clean hotel, friendly staff. I had a room on the top floor (maybe 6th floor). There is a small gym and the Vista restaurant on that floor. My room was non-smoking, most of the hotel appeared to be non smoking. I believe most casinos, restaurants and bars are now non smoking in Santiago, as well as in Santo Domingo. The room I had, there were many windows, about half the room had windows. Small room, clean. Wifi reception throughout the hotel. Breakfast buffet was included, which was in the Vista restaurant. I was told that as a guest of the Hodelpa Centro Plaza that I could use the swimming pool at the Hodelpa El Gran Almirante, which I did on most days. From Hodepla Centro Plaza to El Gran Almirante Hotel was about a ten minute car ride. Very friendly and helpful people in Santiago, I got lost numerous times driving and many people were more than willing to help me. I ate at the Fridays Restaurant adjacent to the El Gran Almirante Hotel, very nice waitress, very clean restaurant. There is a small box on each table, whereby you can press a button and the waitress receives a signal on her wristband that signals her to come over to your table. I also ate at Kuka Maraca restaurant which sits facing the monument. Smoking is allowed in this restaurant on the second floor. The waiters there dress like cowboys with cowboy hats, chaps and holsters with pistols. Food was good. Hodelpa Centro Plaza has a parking area adjacent to the hotel with security.

I've been a Marriott member for well over 20 years. I've stayed in my fair share of Courtyard properties worldwide. While the brand is pretty reliable, almost all have a few consistent nits I have to pick. None here! I had traveled by train to Basel SBB. Up, over, and outside the terminal and to the right I made way for the taxi stand. CHF 50 and 20 minutes later, we were well outside the city center approaching a very modern metal structure with a sweeping entry. I was exhausted but began to feel better immediately. The airiness of everything was inviting. The front desk staff made me feel right at home, helping me to get oriented with services and facilities. Best tip: The clerk Cecile explained local transportation and gave me a tourist pass for trams and buses, plus a map. This ""BaselCard"" pass saves you serious money on the extensive transportation network around the region. The guests seemed to be primarily international businessfolk. This makes sense, as Pratteln is home to numerous multi-nationals across manufacturing, IT, and more. The rail line and A3 motorway make shipping easy into France and Germany and the rest of Europe. You will hear many languages spoken in the hotel lobby. Tourists wanting to save a few francs from city-center expensive properties should not be put off from staying at the Courtyard in spite of the distance to the beautiful old town. A transportation map and said BaselCard will make sure you are whisked efficiently pretty much anywhere in the area from early morning to late at night. Accommodations are modern with bright colors. Bedding was very comfortable. My room faced the rail tracks, and noise was minimal with the window closed. There is no highway rumble or serious industrial noise to distract from a good sleep. Even with a relatively full house, the room remained quiet. I arrived late afternoon a bit hungry after the dining car on the train failed before departure 8 hours earlier. The nearly empty lounge beckoned. The full menu from the Bistro kitchen wasn't yet available, so I settled on a tasty ham and cheese panini (CHF 16) and a beer. Even the server perked me up with welcoming chat about the local area and suggestions to explore the following day. I skipped supper and fell asleep instead. Breakfast the next morning was a bit more hectic as the engineers and salespeople arrived in waves. The staff kept up with great skill. The full monty buffet could set you back CHF 28, but there are soooo many offerings. Splurge a little! At checkout time, Sebastian behind the desk made me feel like a valued guest.

1522,AliceBandB,1657424,Courtyard Basel Pratteln,"Comfort! Clean and comfortable, this hotel is located outside of Basel. The rooms are all new, large and well-kept. Wonderful beds and large showers. The lobby is bright, modern and pleasant, with a small restaurant with a limited, simple menu, (nothing Swiss on it that I recall). The breakfast buffet is wonderful and abundant, with everything from eggs to salmon and freshly baked breads. Parking is extra and there really is no alternative. What is included is a train&public transit ticket for Basel which is actually very smart and convenient considering the trains are frequent and very nicely kept. The ride downtown is quite short. Make sure to get very specific directions for the train station, which is walking distance from the hotel. The girls at the front desk are lovely, friendly, professional and well-trained, including the girl in training who was a real darling and very efficient. The hotel has a nice little workout room, but does not have a pool. The Aquabasilea is not included in your room rate, and, frankly, not worthwhile, even with the reduced rate - at least not for my 15 year old and I.

1552,DonT533,1657424,Courtyard Basel Pratteln,"A bit of a disappointment, but generally nice As a Platinum with Marriott, I try to stay at Marriott properties when convenient, so we booked this hotel when we came to Basel for the Basel Tattoo. The hotel is easy to get to -- particularly if using the public transportation, as it is two stops from the SBB main train station in Basel. If you take the S1 train, you get off at the second stop (Pratteln) and go out to the left. When you get out of the tunnel, look for signs to the Aquabasilea and follow them. The hotel is easy to find, as it is right next to the Aquabasilea, and the signs lead you right there. The location is in what seems to be an industrial area. No stores, shops, or restaurants anywhere nearby (at least that we could see). As noted below, this caused some additional disappointment. The staff were very friendly and helpful, outstanding in fact. The rooms were clean and well-lighted. The bathroom (in our room at least) had only a shower (no tub), and like some European hotels, no washcloths. The hand towel will serve that function, though. All in all, a pleasant and comfortable facility with great staff. A word of caution, however, to other Marriott Gold or Platinum members -- despite the Marriott site assurance that ""In Europe, hotels without a lounge offer a choice of breakfast for two in the restaurant or 750 points."" they don't. No lounge, and no complimentary breakfast -- the breakfast prices were extremely high (but perhaps in line with other Basel hotels), and the lack of restaurants in the area meant we had to catch the train to the Basel main train station, where we were able to find a good breakfast at a reasonable price.

1553,JoeBob85,1657424,Courtyard Basel Pratteln,"This was by-far the worst Marriott experience I have ever had. I called from the train 30 minutes out to confirm reservations and arrange for the advertised shuttle from the local station. I was told, they no longer have the shuttle but could have a taxi waiting for us when we arrive at 9:44PM. On the same call, I asked about dinner in the area and was told there was nothing in this part of town, the only option is the hotel restaurant. I said fine we will eat there, see you noon, and hung up. The taxi picked up at 9:44 and we were at the hotel by 9:50. My wife went to get a table while I checked in. She came back promptly, as she was told the kitchen was already closed. We asked about alternatives and were told the only food in the entire city at this hour (9:50PM) was either the pretzels at the hotel bar of the sandwiches in the vending machines in the hotel lobby. We were tied and hungry, so we ate the dry sandwiches and pretzels with our very expensive drinks from the bar. The next morning, while waiting for our friends, we sat temporarily at a table just off of the lobby floor. In the span of 5 minutes, 2 servers and a manager told us we would have to move, as that section was closed until lunch. We repeatedly said we would move into the restaurant when our friends arrived. We got death stares from the restaurant manager but sill waited it out. After the 5 minutes, our friends arrived and we moved into the “Breakfast Section” and asked about the menu options. They said we could order off the menu but most just did the buffet with the 2 meal plans; overpriced for continental or ridiculously overpriced for hot items such as eggs. We asked about other breakfast options in the city but again were told there is nothing in the area and nothing for breakfast downtown (in a city of 60,000 people). I and my friend decided to skip breakfast and our wives again ate cold bagels from the vending machines in the lobby. Finally, one of the things that appealed to us was the fact that the hotel was connected to the town water park and the guest could use that pool. (Slow down don’t get too excited) When we checked in, amidst the closed kitchen/cold sandwich frustrations, the desk clerk gave us vouchers to the water park and along explanation of the entry fees. We were confused and did not want to pay extra to swim in the “hotel pool”. So after deciding to skip breakfast we thought we should at least look at the waterpark before leaving. The door inside the hotel was convenient but once we used it, we were stopped by someone wanting us to pay to enter, even to look around. We were in street clothes and sandals and said we just wanted to look at the facility. We could not get in without buying a wrist bracelet RFID tag that activated the turnstile. I showed him the voucher from the hotel and he said that was sufficient for entry. ( It would have been less confusing of the front desk just told us to use the voucher.) He took it and gave us ID tags. We started to look around and after finding our way through the maze of changing rooms to the main pool we got about 5 feet in before being stopped by another pool employee, who was incidentally wearing the same sandals I was. He told us we could not be on the pool deck with shoes on and could not come in with street clothes, even to look around. That was it! We found our way back out of the maze, left the hotel, loaded our bags into a taxi and went to the cruise port early.

The hotel itself is mediocre, the breakfast unappetising and the staff are unhelpful and seem untrained. We arrived back at midnight after spending the entire day at the fair, totally exhausted, only to find that our room had not been made up, with dirty towels and an unmade bed. We were enormously frustrated but had no option but to sleep in the unmade bed. We were offered a change of room at midnight, but the thought of spending the next 2 hours moving rooms at midnight did not seem very attractive! We expected that the management would be falling over themselves to apologise and to offer a refund for the day. Instead we were told by a manager, who seemed to have no training in customer relations, that it was our fault. That was because we told the housekeeper that we were still sleeping when she entered the room without knocking at the crack of dawn. It appears that this hotel does not believe in checking again that the room needs to be made up. There is no do not disturb card or a card to indicate they should make up the room.

Now in terms of service it's even worse. No one cares about the customers, they are very rude and don't care for anything. The room service is even worse. They don't refill the coffee machine the coffee creamer is old and the sugars are never stocked. The room service doesn't provide towels, and replenishes coffee tea. Now for the food. Switzerland is a very expensive place. This place does not have a cooking kitchen. They depend on their restaurant for food. I travelled with a 3 year old.

Once at Basel sbb is where one can take the train to Lucerne or Interlaken or bern. The train or walk to tram streets are trough a a parking lot, shady and in an industrial area. It's very creepy! Now in terms of service it's even worse. No one cares about the customers, they are very rude and don't care for anything. The room service is even worse. They don't refill the coffee machine the coffee creamer is old and the sugars are never stocked. The room service doesn't provide towels, and replenishes coffee tea. Now for the food. Switzerland is a very expensive place. This place does not have a cooking kitchen. They depend on their restaurant for food. I travelled with a 3 year old. They do not warm milk, stock fruits or entertain any requests. Especially if you are traveling with a family, I would say don't stay here.",,,,,,,,,-0.255625,negative,2,0,-1

1629,Pirateskully,1657424,Courtyard Basel Pratteln,"Value versus location. We spent two nights here prior to our Viking River Cruise. We had a wonderful stay. I will attempt to address a lot of the issues some other reviews had. First, the staff was great. We called the hotel direct and they answered several questions for us. Transportation: Arriving from the airport, take bus #50 to Basell SBB (central). You only need a photo copy of your room reservation to ride the public transportation until you reach the hotel. At Basel SBB, take the S1 or S3 train to Prattein. There you can take the bus thats listed as ""Aquabasilea"" to the hotel. There in the same complex. The trains run back and forth to Basel every 15 minutes and it is only a 9 minute ride with 1 stop between. At Basel SBB, you can catch a Tram that will get you close to most of the things you want to see if not right next to it. At the hotel, you will be given a ""Mobility Pass"" that allows you to ride free all public transportation during your stay. Location: You can choose to walk from the station to the hotel. It is thru and Industrial area along a small roadway and walkway. The hotel is not located in but, adjacent to it! Walking is fine if you are not hauling luggage. It is only about a 10 minute walk but, just before the hotel is a gravel walkway for about 100 yards that makes pulling luggae difficult. Food Etc.: There is a few options in Prattein. A couple of resturants. The best bet for something simple is the equalivent to a Quickmart about 400 yards away. They have snacks, pastries, sandwiches, beer & wine soda & water and so on. Much cheaper than the breakfast at the hotel. The Hotels website is a little misleading with the photos of the beautiful pool that actually belongs to Aquabasilea and not the hotel. The staff was fantastic. When we called, we asked about luggage storage since we would be arriving at 9 am and they said no problem.

The young lady at the reception was really kind, smiley and professional. Kudos for her. Decent breakfast and a restau that serves reasonably priced dishes.",3,,,,4,3,,,0.193580542,positive,3,0,1

1642,Evita_Neuschwander,1657424,Courtyard Basel Pratteln,"Almost a perfect stay The hotel location is very easy to find, ofcourse when you travel with GPS, but we didn't come there directly because we decided to park our car in SBB Pratteln Station where you can park for 5chf a day, it was a good idea rather than pay 29chf for the hotel parking fee, the bus transportation from the train station to the hotel costed 2.40chf per person, we didn't loose any time at all. We arrived an hour earlier (entirely our fault) and have to wait until 2:00pm, and waited a couple of more minutes because we have been told that our room isn't ready. The room was nice, not exactly how we pictured it (it was a superior guest king room), we thought there'd be a bigger space for the living room, hence just a couch placed beside the tv table infront of the bed. Lovely bed by the way. The toilet was not cleaned properly as I have seen the stains, the toiletries contained a small squeeze tube of shampoo, shower gel and conditioner, just enough for one person (We're a couple), good thing I brought our own body essentials. The wi-fi is not free inside the room, if you want a connection, you will have to pay for it, or you can just go down to the lobby where you can sit and surf the net for free. Despite the small disappointment regarding the hotel room, we managed to have fun in Aquabasilea, we were happy that it was included in our hotel rate (for 261chf), It was really relaxing, the hot baths, saunas, curly slides and the thermal pools are awesome! The night was very calm, the bed is comfortable and so we slept like a baby. We woke up early for breakfast, we just had to, we paid for it and it was all perfect, the buffet is loaded and very delicious, the bacon is a must try!

I was looking for a hotel for the Basel Fasnacht carnival but left it too late to book. Everything in the city was either booked out or prohibitively expensive. I usually prefer to stay in the city centre or near the train station for convenience but as we had no choice I looked further afield and stumbled upon this gem. I agree with other reviewers in saying there is nothing much around in that area and it can seem a bit scary at night because it is so quiet and dark but it is only a 10min s-bahn or 20min tram ride into the city. It was totally by accident that I stumbled upon Aquabasilea which is a huge spa and indoor waterpark right next door to the hotel. We got a weekend rate which included free entry for 2 adults into this complex. Since we only stayed one night at the hotel and were there to see the carnival we did not have much time to spend at Aquabasilea. It is really worth a good half day there. It is a fantastic new, modern, clean, beautiful and amazing water park/spa (full of things to occupy any age group). I would highly recommend staying in this hotel just to be able to experience Aquabasilea easily. (See my separate review for Aquabasilea). Back to the hotel... we arrived around midnight super exhausted but were greeted with a very friendly welcome by a nice lady at reception who was really helpful. The room was of average size and nothing exceptional but very comfortable and super clean. The view we had (see included picture) was of the rooftop of Aquabasilea. It is a very quiet area so we had a great sleep. The lobby area looks very modern and spacious and was a great 'welcome' to the hotel. The restaurant/bar looked beautiful although we didn't get to experience it as we woke up too late for breakfast and preferred to go into town for lunch. If you really need to be in the centre of town I would not recommend staying here but otherwise it is a great hotel and I have no complaints.

Location: This place is really in the middle of nowhere. I might be being dramatic, but this was the impression I had. Around the area are some green fields, small forest, a factory, office buildings, petrol station and some houses (of course the Aquabasilea). It is about 15 mins walking to the train station and another 5 mins to the tram station. [It is the 2nd last stop of Line14]. A 24 hours ticket is approximately 10CHF (depends on which one you get). There is a bus service that runs, but am not sure if it is complimentary or part of the standard bus service Check-in: Arrived rather late, close to midnight, but rather mediocre check-in experience. Strangely the paperwork was prepared, but not complete. I had to fill in my own ID info, phone info and MR#. No recognition as an Elite member. Took another 15 mins to get the keycard encrypted, but after failing to work for the elevator, had to return to the reception, and it took another 15 mins to get the encryption machine to work. In total took more than 1/2 hour from arrival to room without any apologies from the receptionist. Room: Standard room provided with a view towards the roof of the Aquabasilea. Shower/Toilet: Bathroom is on the smaller side, but functional. Water pressure was ok. Typical CY bathroom amenities. Internet: Speed and strength was ok Breakfast: This was quite a good spread. Made to order eggs available. There is Processco available that wants to have the famous champagne/Processco breakfast. I believe for continental breakfast it cost 18 CHF, and American, 24 CHF. On Sundays breakfast is until 2pm! [only other property with such a long Sunday brunch is @ CY Dusseldorf Hafen] Staff: In general, friendly.

Here's what we really liked: Plenty of onsite parking under cover or above with easy access from the hotel, new-looking, modern hotel but with homely, sympathetic decor, very friendly and helpful staff (although the hotel was very quiet so they had plenty of time to provide a good service), great, large rooms, free Wifi in the lobby, in-room safe, very pleasant bar and restaurant, with the opportunity to sit outside (just far enough away from the carpark and road), good choice of food for the continental breakfast, with a clear understanding that the hot food 'American breakfast' was extra (but it wasn't clear how much extra), large, firm mattress but soft, plentiful bedding and unusual blinds outside the bedroom window. We also had a problem with our TV, which was fixed within 5 minutes - great service. The hotel appears to be mainly geared towards business travellers, and we noted the first floor with meeting rooms and breakout areas looked very nice. However, the best bit was the Aquabasilica, which came at no extra cost (apart from Spa treatments) on top of the room charge and is accessed from within the hotel. We decided to have an hour or so in there on Saturday morning, but were amazed by its size, the amazing range of wonderfully-heated pools, water jets, outdoor pool, plenty of sunbeds (which looked brand new), and oh happy days, a fantastic range of water slides! We ended up spending much longer there than planned and had a fantastic time. The few not-so-good bits, more like things to be aware of: The changing rooms in the Aquabasilica were pretty much unisex. There were areas identified for men and women, but all in the same area. There wasn't a huge selection in the restaurant for dinner (although the food was great), and parking still cost CH29 for one night! As mentioned, it was not clear how much extra that hot 'American breakfast' cost, although small cards were placed on all breakfast tables to be filled in by guests, clearly stating which breakfast they had paid for. Had we wanted to have a hot breakfast it wasn't clear how much exta a spoonful of bacon and eggs would cost. The blinds in the room were very effective to filter the sun, but the controls were not easily found. A call to Reception revealed they were by the entrance door, which seemed like totally the wrong place for them but finally the room was flooded with light when we worked them out.

1684,Stevie390,1657424,Courtyard Basel Pratteln,"Immaculate but be careful of the expensive extras The Courtyard hotel is in an industrial suburb to the east of Basel. It is part of a complex that includes a waterpark and shops. It was handy as a stopover for me, but I wouldn’t suggest using it for seeing the sights of Basel city. As far as I can tell, there is no direct bus or tram link between the hotel and the city centre. Nevertheless, the Courtyard is a modern and high quality facility. My room was a good size with all amenities provided including coffee, tea, safe, iron, etc. It was spotlessly clean, in super condition and with comfortable and practical furnishings.

Food plentiful on typical items like club sandwhich, excellent fries or hamburgers (with ketchup, french mayo - try it on fries...and hot brown mustard).

1701,DaveGski,1657424,Courtyard Basel Pratteln,"A stop near Basel As part of our Rhineradweg tour, we stayed overnight at the Courtyard at Prattelin in near Basel. We enjoyed our stay although did not spend much time on the property, instead we spent most of our time touring Basel and riding up the Rhine, and as a result we did not have time to visit the Aquabasilea (adjoining waterpark). Although the location is near an industrial park, the property is clean and not far from a train-station with frequent connections to Basel SSB (main train station). For those driving, the Courtyard has both garage parking and open parking but the price is the same at 29 Francs per Day. The rooms are typically high quality Marriott, very clean, and we experienced a helpful staff. The restaurant, Max, has more or less international cuisine, and serves the full menu until 2200 and a mini-menu until 2330. Room service is not available.

Bed comfortable, small but adequate fitness center. Now, the ""rest of the story""...The Basel Courtyard by Marriott isn't in Basel, but in a suburb of Basel called Prattein. It requires a daily commute to and from Basel. One can take a 15-20 minute tram (line 14), or 7-10 minute train into town (train goes to Basel SSB-HBF.. The main train station. The hotel is a 10 minute walk to train station near hotel, or 15 minute walk to tram stop just a block past train station on Baunhauptstrasse (Street Name). Also one bus line (83) also goes to town, every 30 minutes but takes 30-35 minutes. It leaves from front of train station. On weekends there is a shuttle ever ten minutes to hotel from station, but during week runs only from 4-8 pm. Cab fare from hotel to train or tram (5 minutes) is $15-20! The hotel sits next to a water park. The hotel web site says pool, but the pool is in the water park ($25 admission required). Prattein is a large industrial park area, so very limited activites outside hotel. Hotels ""in Basel"" usually provide a daily tram pass for extensive public transportation system. The Courtyard does not, so you need to purchase daily tram/rail Ticket each day ($8.50). So plan on ten minute walk to train or tram, 7-20 minute ride to town, plus any connections if going to a specific area. Then, of course, depends on connections with tram or train which run every 10-15 minutes. So, travel time varies, unless you watch schedules and connect quickly. For a tourist adds a little adventure, except in rain! For business maybe more frustrating. Hotel states Internet in every room, but again $28 per day! Also no breakfast included: $19 continental $29 buffet. Parking $25 per day. We were in Basel for Art Basel, their busiest week of the year, so we paid double their regular rates, and had 4 night minimum. I think, regularly, their prices may be more completive, but I don't know. Otherwise Internet and breakfast charges etc are all their standard charges.

Also one bus line (83) also goes to town, every 30 minutes but takes 30-35 minutes. It leaves from front of train station. On weekends there is a shuttle ever ten minutes to hotel from station, but during week runs only from 4-8 pm. Cab fare from hotel to train or tram (5 minutes) is $15-20! The hotel sits next to a water park. The hotel web site says pool, but the pool is in the water park ($25 admission required). Prattein is a large industrial park area, so very limited activites outside hotel. Hotels ""in Basel"" usually provide a daily tram pass for extensive public transportation system. The Courtyard does not, so you need to purchase daily tram/rail Ticket each day ($8.50). So plan on ten minute walk to train or tram, 7-20 minute ride to town, plus any connections if going to a specific area. Then, of course, depends on connections with tram or train which run every 10-15 minutes. So, travel time varies, unless you watch schedules and connect quickly. For a tourist adds a little adventure, except in rain! For business maybe more frustrating. Hotel states Internet in every room, but again $28 per day! Also no breakfast included: $19 continental $29 buffet. Parking $25 per day. We were in Basel for Art Basel, their busiest week of the year, so we paid double their regular rates, and had 4 night minimum. I think, regularly, their prices may be more completive, but I don't know. Otherwise Internet and breakfast charges etc are all their standard charges. These are all things to consider when choosing this hotel",5,1,2,5,4,4,,,0.078192873,neutral,4,1,0

1720,PrincesseEm,1657424,Courtyard Basel Pratteln,"Lovely staff, great hotel! Spent 3 nights at this hotel last weekend. This was our second stay at the hotel and it was fantastic. My only real complaint is the cost of the internet (28CHF/day) but this is normal for Switzerland - I just wish when one pays for a ""deluxe/upgraded"" room the internet was included. My flight arrived at 8:30 am and I arrived at the hotel around 10am. I was able to check in immediately which was really appreciated after a 10 hour flight from Calgary. The room was great, very comfortable and very large by European standards. We absolutely LOVED having a kitchenette - saved lots of money buying ready-made dishes at the local Co-op and heating them up in the microwave. I never did figure out how to use the Nespresso machine but we're not big coffee drinkers so I didn't bother asking. We loved having a separate seating area and work desk. It was nice to be able to sit down somewhere other than the bed! Our room rate included a full American-style buffet breakfast which we both thoroughly enjoyed. There were many hot and cold options available and it was nice to have servers bringing coffee and tea. There is a nice patio outdoors where you can enjoy your breakfast if it is sunny (we also enjoyed having an afternoon beverage outdoors on the couches). Parking was expensive (29CHF/day again not unusual for Switzerland) but there was free outdoor parking right next to the hotel. Our room overlooked said parking and we were able to check on our vehicle regularly though there was really no need - Switzerland is safe and secure. Our room rate also included our entrance to the Aquabasilea complex that is attached to the hotel, although we had to argue with the front desk staff about this inclusion. I ended up having to email a copy of the Hotels.com reservation that proved this to the hotel, but they were very accommodating after that. The Aquabasilea complex is an amazing ""waterpark"" that includes a gym, sauna, several pools, waterslides and a spa. We wish we would have checked it out sooner – we would have spent the whole day there. There’s even a swim-up bar similar to those you find at an all-inclusive resort. The hotel provides towels and bathrobes if you ask. I forgot to mention that the airline delayed my luggage upon arrival and the hotel was great in checking regularly for updates on its’ whereabouts for me. They certainly went above and beyond what was required of them in this regard. Overall we loved the hotel this time and the last time we visited. We will be back – hopefully they continue to develop the area so that there are more restaurants/retail stores nearby. If the weather is nice it’s not too far to walk to the shopping center down the road and the train station is a nice easy 5-10 minute walk away as well.

Delighted then with the apartment view, overlooking the outdoor pool, with mountains to our right & a clear view of the sea to our left. The other massive plus was the closeness to the beach. We walked out of our apartment block, walked through an archway, and we were straight on the beach. On several mornings, my wife & i got up early & went for a short sea swim. The apartment beach was narrow & crowded, but we walked along the coast, and a few hundred yards down, found a wider open beach, with some old goal posts- perfect for our 3 boys. Next to this was a beach bar-perfect for us! The Sognu di Regna complex was fine. The only down sides were a lack of comfortable seats in the apartment lounge and no wifi outside reception. Staff were fine. Facilities were a short drive or walk away in Moriani Plage. Some good water sport options there too (pedaloes with slides were fun, catermarans or wind surfing, with tuition).

1750,laurenrose,1230627,Residence Sognu di Rena San Nicolao Haute Corse Corsica,"looks lovely, but very small and poor quality apartments The apartments look very attractive from the outside, very disappointing on the inside, the build quality is very very poor, the apartments are tiny, there is no aircon and the rooms aren't ventilated, the bathroom had 1 vent which goes through into a bedroom ( mmm nice). I wouldn't like to stay there in hot summer months. The apt we hired had two bedrooms and advertised for up to 6 people- no chance!!. The rooms had small wardrobes but you couldn't open them properly as the bed stopped them, there was very limited storage for suitcases etc. There was nothing provided not even a loo roll, bedding had to be hired and turned out to be very expensive, mismatching poor quality that looked like some-one had cleared their bedding out at home to use in a holiday let. There is no where to eat inside so you have to use the outside balcony - not good if the weather isn't fine . You would struggle to self cater as the cooking facility is very basic and there is no room, there is a cooker, hob and sink which are side by side and that's it with no work space. The location and Corsica itself is great but the Sognu di Rena was poor.",Hotel_Review-g1194567-d1230627-Reviews-Residence_Sognu_di_Rena-San_Nicolao_Haute_Corse_Corsica.html,2010-07-01T00:00:00,"looks lovely, but very small and poor quality apartments","The apartments look very attractive from the outside, very disappointing on the inside, the build quality is very very poor, the apartments are tiny, there is no aircon and the rooms aren't ventilated, the bathroom had 1 vent which goes through into a bedroom ( mmm nice).

1751,olivercarey,1230627,Residence Sognu di Rena San Nicolao Haute Corse Corsica,"no bar, zero service, stony beach and 5 euros to wash clothes!! my partner and I visited Corsica as part of a cruise and were very excited to return. We booked with easyjet to save over £1,000 by travelling with Corsican places, the flight was fine both ways, despite some very relaxed parents, storms, torrential rain and delays. We got a taxi from the airport, priced by the (very corsican) 'tariff' ..£70 euros. The resorts bar was open on our arrival, but only served water, fizzy drinks and martini. We stayed for 2 weeks and only was the bar open another 2 times after this, families with children taking their own water to the pool, no service on the beach at all so be aware. The hotels on a very busy main road which leads to the village with a few bars and restaurants, nothing to warrant dressing up but certainly to warrant euros on drinks, our drinks were the same usually altho the bills would be different each visit, varying up to 10 euros. guess the bill became a popular game! The food was average, amazing moules and generous servings but nothing as nice as the food in the larger towns. The bars are all tatty, except one that had been built during our stay, it faces the beach and was clean and new. The Hotel offers excellent self catering facilties, all cooking equipments, altho the washing mahcine is 5 euros for one wash and another 5 if you require the dryer. no maid service and only one set of towels for 2 weeks, unless you want to buy extra! the complex is very echo-ey, if that makes sense, the French are very quiet, as are we, altho when some noisy people turned up it disturbes eveyone, a lot!!! the bedroom faced the corridor so if anyone walked past the noise is loud, also the bedroom was small and stuffy. Given the choice this is not a good 'resort' to visit, the other towns are more central and busier, the walk along the main road to get anywhere isn't a pleasant one. The butchers was excellent although we were charged £11 euros for a slice of quiche, it was lovely but no way worth that price. The car hire was £400 euros for one week (renault clio) and it is to be returned washed and hoovered, strictly! Restaurants outside the resort were good, some of the loveliest food was at a northern village which name escapes me, but its north west by a large marina. Some beautiful beaches are south of the resort but at least an hours drive, perhaps more, for pure sand beaches. Don't expect smiley service, you won't get it.",Hotel_Review-g1194567-d1230627-Reviews-Residence_Sognu_di_Rena-San_Nicolao_Haute_Corse_Corsica.html,2010-06-01T00:00:00,"no bar, zero service, stony beach and 5 euros to wash clothes!!","my partner and I visited Corsica as part of a cruise and were very excited to return.
