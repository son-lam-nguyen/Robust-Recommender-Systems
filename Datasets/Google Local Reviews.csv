1,5,2623125,"This is a review that is long overdo. I've been enjoying the great pizza at this restaurant for over a year now and it's hands down the best in town. I saw a review on here saying the pizza was greasy, and I'll bet it was for a peperoni pizza. I don't know how you could put so many slices of peperoni on, where you can't even see the cheese, without a little pepperoni grease escaping. These guys at Firehouse make the pizzas that everyone else does in their commercials, you can watch as they pile the toppings a mile high on every pie. And when was the last time you saw someone slicing bell peppers and tomatoes by hand for your pizza. I honestly have a hard time understanding how these guys stay in business, but I'm glad they do. And the five dollar slice and soda lunch is probably the best value in town. Thanks guys, keep it up.","['European Restaurant', 'Italian Restaurant', 'Pizza Restaurant']",328045,1394826388,3/14/2014,"[40.178074, -122.235234]",$$,3/14/2014 19:46,19,46,28,0.311134706,positive,1

10,1,5118821,"Have been going to this restaurant for years and always enjoyed fresh sliced turkey dinner with the sides and pie for dessert for a reasonable price.  On this Thanksgiving Day all four in our party ordered the above but received pressed turkey, cold and uncooked yams served in little cut up squares, uncooked veggies.  It was terrible and we sent it back and ordered the fresh cut ham but it was canned ham and the sides were the same as above.  They would not allow us to order from the regular menu and the charge for this terrible dinner was $24.95 each.  The apple pie tasted okay. They have lost mine and my entire family's business.  I know these had to be different owners than the ones in the past.  The staff was all Asian, either Chinese or Japanese so perhaps they just do not know how to run an American restaurant.

96,3,1999723,"I have a few complaints about this store. #1 This store has been open long enough to know what sells and when. If you go into the store to buy something and there is absolutely nothing on the shelves time after time, someone isn't doing their job. As an example, the pet food section. It isn't unusual to find nothing at all on the shelves, especially on traditional high sales days like the first of the month and Fridays. Certainly they KNOW these are very high sales days. Someone in charge of ordering isn't doing their job. The same goes for all the other departments as well. #2 Garden Department. Our growing season is different than other parts of the country, but the company responsible for stocking plants and trees does a poor job. We have a much longer growing season than many parts of the country, but vegetable plants are brought in at the very beginning of the season, and that's it. With many weeks left for planting, there is nothing to buy. The selection is pitifully small too. There are more vegetables that will grow here besides peppers, tomatoes, zucchini and eggplant. Fruit trees should be planted during the colder months, NOT during the summer, but that's when you can find the largest selection. Poor ordering once again. #3 Employees While the employees are friendly enough, there are far too few of them. Long lines at the checkout and the service desk are really a pain in the neck. Most of the cashiers are pretty good and do the best they can, but there are a few who chat with the customers non stop, and that slows down the whole line. They seem oblivious to the frustration expressed by the people waiting in line. In addition to problems at the check-out and service desk, it's sometimes very hard to find someone to help. They may be really busy trying to get stuff on the shelves and aren't pleased to be stopped in the middle. For instance, the dairy cases. If I want something, but the space for that product is empty, but I can actually see cases stacked in the back, through the glass, I naturally want someone to get it for me.  Just NOT enough employees to keep the store stocked.  The store is clean, the prices are fairly reasonable, but the people of not only Pahrump, but all the smaller, surrounding communities DEPEND on THIS Walmart for so many things. If Walmart doesn't have it, it might mean a trip to Las Vegas and a trip of 150 miles or more to find what we need. When Walmart came to our community, a lot of smaller businesses closed. That's really too bad, but new businesses are opening. That means that Walmart isn't our only choice any more. So listen up Walmart.

Long answer:  As I said, they open way before they actually serve, which is weird. I was told it was because they are in an industrial park, but that doesn't actually make any sense. They have an enormous beer selection but most lack any robust character. Also as stated, they do not do much with hops, so if that's what you're into then you should find somewhere else. Bruery goes for a different style which favors sours and belgians. I must admit the sour I had was good, but the belgian was pretty ordinary, as was the rest of what I had.

That closed, and soon after Alain and Martine opened Palmie.  In Palm Springs it was a Parisian style bistro with posters of Aznavour and Bardot on the walls, but now in Palm Desert is it set up more like a French country inn which is actually more in keeping with its identity.  The location isn't perfect, being part of a retail center, but once you get inside it's easy to forget your surroundings and indulge in the wonderful food and the gracious treatment you receive from a truly family owned and operated business.  The food is excellent.  The menu is not extensive, but it's enough to satisfy any taste; they focus on doing less dishes really well rather than a wide range of things done fairly well.

I needed furniture quickly and I was able to get it through them. They are sales people and can be seen as pushy because their job is to sell... however they were very helpful every time I went in. I have a TV, couches, and washer/dryer through them. They will call you daily if you are a couple of days late on your payment but if you just let them know that you won't be able to make the payment for another few days they are totally ok with it. They do warn you though that they are still required to call daily until the payment is made. I just ignore those calls if it happens because we have already made the agreement and they know I'll be paying it another day. If you do ignore the calls and don't make an arangement with them, they will call your contacts on your application. That's understandable though... it's technically their product you are leasing and they want to ensure you haven't just run off with it. Make sure you call and make arrangements if you cannot make your payment on time.   The only downside to this program, of course, is that in the long run it is more expensive than just going and buying furniture.

Some examples.  - This is the Gaslamp district and so is loud and bustling through until 2/3am. Given the expense spent on buying B&O HDTV's and Wall mounted stereos (BeoSound 1 on the wall and BeoVision 4) a little double glazed windows to block the sound would seem like a minor expense. - The Lavazza coffee machine is great but providing one coffee and one tea for a room being occupied by two smacks of an immaturity in running a hotel.  - Providing a beautiful rain shower in room but not refilling the toiletries when they run out.  Without doubt this is a lovely hotel (great bed, double sinks in room, friendly staff) with a lot of potential, right in the heart of the gaslamp district but until they get some of the basics right I imagine other guests will be left feeling slightly disappointed.","['Hotel', 'Banquet Hall', 'Boutique Hotel']",6924706,1278895242,7/11/2010,"[32.713742, -117.16048]",$,7/12/2010 0:40,0,40,42,-0.022888286,neutral,0

Having just visited Palm Springs for the first time I understand why writing fake reviews would be so important, with a small collection of restaurants vying for trade it must have become an industry all of its own.  British, live in San Francisco so I've experience the best and the worst the world has to offer :)   We went for dinner and Jakes is really good. Welcoming and friendly staff offered indoors (aircon) or outside, courtyard (misters) we took the misters  Example of good service: We sat, chatting the waiter came upand I sat back, the table wobbled but I didn't notice, he did . In a moment the waiter said ""let me get that"" and fixed it. Example of surprising attention to detail: An amuse-bouche was unexpected. Most importantly the food: Heirloom Tomato salad with goats cheese - Delicious, fresh and full of flavour Meatloaf and Mac&Cheese.. didn't use macaroni but rather larger rigatoni but god did it taste good. Meatloaf was large, filling and delicious with a spicy ketchup. Chicken Milanese...the breast left thick and crisp on a salad of Arugula and tomatoes  Gazpacho - fresh, spicy and plentiful Scallops - If you're read this far you're keen and realise how easy Scallops are to screw up. These had been seared with basil and had a gorgeous hint of the flavor. really good. Ahi Tuna 2 ways - great.   My only criticism would be that the chef obviously feels a need to garnish the plates with a little parsley when there is no need,  the food honestly speaks for itself.

Our third visit has soured the taste and as we overheard another couple discussing how let down they were we may not be alone.   We arrived early in case we could be seated,  we were told it would be very unlikely to be before 9. No suggestion of taking a place at the bar and as 9 came and wait no updates either.  We asked and were told 'a table are just standing so it should be a minute',  25 minutes later we ask again,  this time with the owner nearby.   Apologies were made and an appetizer offered in apology which was appreciated.   The food sadly was just a touch lacking,  short ribs a little dry tomatoes seemed fresh from safeway.  No offer of water,  and when provided,  no refill.  The cheesecake was okay.   Overall it feels as if they've had some staff turnover,  the front of house staff soured things from the outset and in spite of many waiting staff it was a challenge to get some of the basics right.   As a side note and  for anyone else there on this evening ,  there also happened to be a couple intent on pushing social boundaries which really lowered the tone and went uninterrupted by staff.","['Californian Restaurant', 'American Restaurant']",2907059,1341807988,7/8/2012,"[33.542619, -117.783097]",$,7/9/2012 4:26,4,26,28,-0.393683719,negative,-1

But this one has taken the cake in having the worst customer service. The waitress did not only tell us she did not know the prices and to look it up our selves  with such an attitude like it was my responsibility to know the prices of their food. Plus everytime we asked her for something she made it seem like it was an unconvince to get it for us. Then we asked for desert and then she said they did have it and then the table next to us got that desert like two min later. But that was not what took the cake. It was the fact that it was veterens day and they didn't give myself and my mother after 20 plus years of service are free meal which was ok seeing how they did it the day prior but in there advertisement it was for today. But we had to literly fight for are 10% off for military discount. Then the waitress said it was only a couple of dollars and she would have to take are credit cards back and do it all over again with the worst attitude ever. So in conclusion if you are a military vet or someone who just likes good customer service with no attitude or you want a meal without feeling like your bothering them then don't ever go to this applebees.

727,5,3011356,"I read the reviews on this place and most were terrible. But it did fluctuate over the years. Then I saw the review from FEB 14 2012. I used to be in the wireless industry a long time ago and I can easily say some of these reviews negatively affect the store because of a customers incompetence. Example the guy complaining about insurance... have you ever had insurance where there wasn't a deductible? Car accident, $7,000.00 in damages. $500.00 deductible. You buy a phone on a contract which the company(not the rep) takes a loss on but makes up for it on a 2yr agreement. Example iPhone 4S 16GB is $199.99 with a contract. $700.00 at full retail, no upgrade for 20mo unless you add-a-line(lowest cost with Verizon is $9.99mo). Insurance deductible $150 prepaid insurance(most popular iPhone insurance because its new and not a refurb) $200 for 2years. $150+$200=$350. Cheaper than $700(you save half the price). Anyway. I went in and was Greeted by Danny. He was a great guy. The manager was there(Robert Ramirez) and even though I was being sufficently helped, greeted me and asked me if he could do anything for me. The fact he took the time to just to greet me and offer assistance blew me away. Turns out the stores under new management because it was suffering with customer service(I have been to other gowireless's in Temecula and have had amazing service. Marlon Meija off of temecula parkway was amazing!). I upfront told them I wasn't interested in buying anything, and that I wanted to lower my bill. They spent an hour in a half diagnosing, adjusting, and giving me options on my bill. I ended up doing a buy one get one free on RAZRS(I had a droid x and an original droid before) and still saved $40 monthly on my bill. They adjusted my rate plan and gave me future guidance on it. They noticed a fluke in the system which caused me an unexplainable spike on my bill for two months in a row. This spike had happened 5months ago. The manager, Robert Ramirez, immediately called customer service while Danny helped me set up my new phones. The spike costed me an extra $83 on my bill total. Robert didn't give up until I got a FULL credit on my bill. I have to say I will never go to any other store! They went above and beyond for me! Even before the RAZRS became a real option. And, unlike most stores, they weren't incredibly aggressive about closing me on the RAZRS, they were more concerned about my happiness and my customer loyalty. I also learned(and the receipt states the policy clearly) all of their chargers, car chargers, and cases have a life time warranty! If it breaks just bring the defective device or its pieces to any gowireless and they will replace it. You don't even need the receipt because their products are labled.

The popcorn tasted stale and wasn't warm.  So,  I'm assuming it was made much earlier.  The bacon and jalapeÃ±o were absent.  Once in a while I could get a hint of bacon,  but I'd bet $100 that there were no jalapeÃ±o anything in that so called appetizer.  My fiancÃ© got a chorizo dip with some nacho type chips.  The dip was very good,  but the chips, again,  were cold and stale.  It was like they just pulled them out of a bag..... I'd say it was poor service and poor food for this upscale,  supposedly legendary top of the mark restaurant.  They must have lost that vibe back in the 20s. We're not going back.  BTW,  this was not happy hour,  it was around 7pm. We never did get any silverware or napkins,  just bar napkins with our few beers.","['Lounge', 'Restaurant']",3653594,1349789139,10/9/2012,"[37.791723, -122.410298]",$,10/9/2012 13:25,13,25,39,-0.549907714,negative,-1

Maybe to some people but they do an adequate job on the food despite their challenging huge menu and the 100+ items on there.  Is this place good for someone who's watching their weight or on a restricted diet?  Temptation and self control will be required to avoid veering off your chosen path.  Cheesecake Factory is family friendly and offers that can please everyone.

I had expected some giant kitchen setup like a butchery but it's really just a small counter/cashier that they funnel you through.  I didn't really care for the atmosphere - crowded picnic tables and some smaller tables in a big back room that also has a bar.  We got a table outside - I was happy to get out of that room.  I could not understand why there was a DJ.  This place was a little too hip for my liking but I really enjoyed the food.","['American Restaurant', 'Brewpub', 'Bar & Grill']",1134160,1307308343,6/5/2011,"[34.045686, -118.236081]",$$,6/5/2011 21:12,21,12,23,0.525063815,positive,1

The staff was very friendly, too, which is a nice touch.

On one hand it's great that everyone's having fun but when a dozen people are pounding the counter, banging tables and cheering loudly it gets annoying really quickly.  It's a very loud space to begin with (concrete floors and high ceilings); sitting outside is almost as noisy with all the traffic on Fairfax.
