# Robust-Recommender-Systems
Integrating Shapley Value-driven Valuation (SVV) and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA-BERT)

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and results for the research project:
‚ÄúIntegrating Shapley Value-driven Pruning and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Robust Recommender Systems.‚Äù
The project aims to build a robust, sentiment-aware recommender system that combines data pruning (SVV) and aspect-level sentiment analysis (ABSA-BERT) to improve accuracy, robustness, and explainability.

üß† 1. Project Overview

Traditional recommender systems often suffer from noisy data, biased interactions, and limited interpretability.
This project proposes a hybrid framework that integrates:

SVV (Shapley Value-driven Valuation): quantifies and removes low-value interactions to reduce noise and improve robustness.

ABSA-BERT: extracts aspect-level sentiment signals from reviews to enhance semantic understanding.

By fusing these two methods, the system generates accurate, reliable, and explainable recommendations ‚Äî particularly effective in the tourism and hospitality domains where user feedback is emotional and diverse.

- LightGCN Baseline.py:	Graph-based collaborative model using simplified GCN layers for recommendations.
- AE Baseline.py: AutoEncoder-based collaborative filtering baseline.
- DAE Baseline.py:	Denoising AutoEncoder, used as the base model for SVV training.
- DeepCoNN Baseline.py: Deep Cooperative Neural Network combining user and item text reviews.
- SVV Baseline.py: Implements Shapley Value-driven Valuation (SVV) for noise pruning and robustness.
- ABSA-BERT Baseline.py: Performs Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using BERT to extract fine-grained sentiment embeddings.
- SVV and ABSA-BERT Baseline.py:	Final hybrid model (ours) combining both SVV and ABSA-BERT for robust and explainable recommendations.

Run Baselines: 
- python "BPRMF Baseline.py"
- python "LightGCN Baseline.py"

Each script:
- Loads the dataset
- Trains the model
- Evaluates using Recall@K, NDCG@K, AUC, RMSE
- ...
  
üìä 5. Evaluation Metrics
- Recall@K: Measures how many relevant items appear in the top-K recommendations.
- NDCG@K: Evaluates the ranking quality and order of recommendations.
- MRR@K: Measures ranking accuracy using the first relevant item.
- Accuracy@K: Fraction of correctly predicted items within top-K.
- AUC: Measures model discrimination between positive and negative samples.
- RMSE: Measures deviation between predicted and true ratings (lower is better).
