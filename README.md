# Robust-Recommender-Systems
Integrating Shapley Value-driven Valuation (SVV) and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA-BERT)

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and results for the research project:
‚ÄúIntegrating Shapley Value-driven Pruning and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Robust Recommender Systems.‚Äù
The project aims to build a robust, sentiment-aware recommender system that combines data pruning (SVV) and aspect-level sentiment analysis (ABSA-BERT) to improve accuracy, robustness, and explainability.

üß† 1. Project Overview

Traditional recommender systems often suffer from noisy data, biased interactions, and limited interpretability.
This project proposes a hybrid framework that integrates:

SVV (Shapley Value-driven Valuation): quantifies and removes low-value interactions to reduce noise and improve robustness.

ABSA-BERT: extracts aspect-level sentiment signals from reviews to enhance semantic understanding.

By fusing these two methods, the system generates accurate, reliable, and explainable recommendations ‚Äî particularly effective in the tourism and hospitality domains where user feedback is emotional and diverse.
